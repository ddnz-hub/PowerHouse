## **1\. Purpose of This Document**

* Why this playbook exists  
* How this document should be read  
* What this document is explicitly *not*

---

## **2\. Orientation: One Research Program, Multiple Refractions**

* The research posture governing all Inverse pilots  
* Why pilots are treated as refracted expressions of a single research program  
* The difference between *convergence* and *coordination*  
* Why sequencing is internal, sensed, and not imposed

### **Governance Boundary Principle**

Inverse pilots are explicitly designed to demonstrate **what governance systems cannot do alone — without undermining governance itself**.

Governance is treated as a **necessary but insufficient condition** for coherent action under pressure. Where governance specifies rules, permissions, and accountability, Inverse research explores what remains unresolved when rules are:

* incomplete  
* conflicting  
* lagging lived reality  
* or silent

Pilots may therefore interface with existing governance systems **not** to replace them, optimise them, or reinterpret them, but to:

* expose their edges under real-world pressure  
* explore decision and execution dynamics that governance cannot pre-specify

## **1\. Purpose of This Document**

### **Why This Playbook Exists**

This playbook exists to provide a **clear, bounded structure** for conducting and stewarding Inverse pilots as a single, coherent research program expressed through multiple domains.

It establishes:

* the posture under which pilots are initiated  
* the boundaries that govern what pilots may and may not do  
* the conditions required for research to proceed without narrative collapse, premature claims, or unintended leverage

The playbook is designed to support **research-only execution under conditions of coherence**, where learning emerges through contact with reality rather than through abstraction, optimisation, or persuasion.

### **How This Document Should Be Read**

This document should be read as a **governing spine**, not as a catalogue of projects or a roadmap of delivery.

Key reading principles:

* Sections are ordered to establish *posture before activity*  
* Later sections assume the constraints set earlier  
* No section is optional; omission implies misalignment  
* Language is intentionally restrained to preserve reversibility

Pilots described herein are **expressions of one research program**, not independent initiatives. Their inclusion signals suitability for inquiry, not readiness for execution.

### **What This Document Is Explicitly *Not***

This playbook is not:

* a product roadmap  
* an investment prospectus  
* a go-to-market strategy  
* a claims document  
* a performance or impact report

It does not:

* promise outcomes  
* forecast returns  
* assert efficacy  
* imply deployment  
* confer authority

Any interpretation of this document as promotional, extractive, or outcome-guaranteeing is a misreading of its intent.

---

## **2\. Orientation: One Research Program, Multiple Refractions**

### **The Research Posture Governing All Pilots**

Inverse operates as a single research program concerned with **coherent action under real-world pressure**.

This program does not begin from solutions, optimisation targets, or future claims. It begins from the observation that many contemporary systems fail not because of insufficient intelligence or computation, but because **discernment collapses under complexity, speed, and consequence**.

All pilots exist to explore this condition directly, through contact with reality, rather than through abstraction or theoretical generalisation.

### **Why Pilots Are Treated as Refractions of One Program**

Pilots are not independent experiments. They are **refractions**—domain-specific expressions of the same underlying inquiry.

Each pilot:

* engages a different system boundary  
* encounters distinct forms of pressure  
* reveals unique failure modes and signals

Yet all contribute to the same question:

*What enables coherent decision and execution when rules, narratives, and incentives are insufficient?*

Insights are therefore allowed to **echo across pilots** without requiring synthesis, alignment, or unification.

### **Convergence vs Coordination**

Inverse distinguishes carefully between *convergence* and *coordination*.

* **Coordination** is imposed: timelines, milestones, dependencies, and outcomes are aligned in advance.  
* **Convergence** is sensed: patterns repeat, tensions recur, and coherence reveals itself across contexts.

Pilots are allowed to converge naturally through shared signal, not forced into coordination through planning.

### **Why Sequencing Is Internal, Not Imposed**

Pilot sequencing is determined by **readiness, constraint, and field conditions**, not by external schedules or narrative momentum.

This means:

* some pilots may remain dormant  
* others may proceed briefly and pause  
* ordering may change without explanation

This is intentional. Coherence degrades when sequencing is imposed to satisfy expectation rather than reality.

### **Governance Boundary Principle**

Inverse pilots are explicitly designed to demonstrate **what governance systems cannot do alone — without undermining governance itself**.

Governance is treated as a **necessary but insufficient condition** for coherent action under pressure. Where governance specifies rules, permissions, and accountability, Inverse research explores what remains unresolved when rules are:

* incomplete  
* conflicting  
* lagging lived reality  
* or silent

Pilots may therefore interface with existing governance systems **not** to replace them, optimise them, or reinterpret them, but to:

* expose their edges under real-world pressure  
* explore decision and execution dynamics that governance cannot pre-specify

Governance remains intact. Its limits are simply made visible.

---

## **3\. Research Vectors (Orientation Only)**

These research vectors function as **lenses**, not categories of selection or ownership.

They exist to help locate *where* a pilot is making contact with the underlying research program, not to define *what* the pilot is or *what it must produce*.

A single pilot may sit across multiple vectors simultaneously. This is expected.

### **3.1 Field Sensing & Coherence Detection**

This vector concerns the capacity to **sense conditions before they collapse into explicit signals, metrics, or narratives**.

Research within this vector explores:

* how pressure accumulates in systems  
* how coherence degrades or stabilises under load  
* how early indicators appear before failure or transition  
* how sensing differs from measurement

The focus is not prediction, but **attunement**—detecting when a system is moving toward or away from coherence.

### **3.2 Governance-First AI & Endogenous Constraint**

This vector addresses systems designed to operate under **explicit rules, permissions, and accountability structures**.

Research here explores:

* where governance succeeds in constraining behaviour  
* where governance fails to resolve ambiguity  
* how constraint is internalised versus imposed  
* how systems behave at the edge of policy completeness

The emphasis is on understanding **the limits of rule-based governance**, especially under novelty, conflict, or time pressure.

### **3.3 Human–System Interface & Meaning Formation**

This vector examines the interface between humans and complex systems, particularly where meaning, trust, and agency are at stake.

Research includes:

* how humans interpret system outputs under pressure  
* how authority and responsibility are signalled or obscured  
* how meaning collapses or stabilises in high-stakes contexts  
* how interfaces shape discernment rather than compliance

The concern is not usability alone, but **how sense is made and action is authorised**.

### **3.4 Physical & Ecological System Feedback**

This vector grounds research in **material reality**—land, bodies, infrastructure, and ecological limits.

It explores:

* how physical systems resist abstraction  
* how feedback loops enforce constraint  
* how ecological limits surface misalignment  
* how coherence is maintained or lost in non-digital domains

This vector ensures research remains tethered to **irreducible consequence**.

### **Why Pilots May Sit in Multiple Vectors**

Real-world systems do not respect conceptual boundaries.

A pilot may simultaneously involve:

* field sensing and governance  
* human meaning and physical constraint  
* regulatory logic and ecological feedback

This overlap is intentional and informative.

### **Why Overlap Is a Signal, Not a Problem**

Where vectors overlap, **pressure concentrates**.

These intersections often reveal:

* latent contradictions  
* unarticulated assumptions  
* boundary failures between domains

Such overlap is treated as a **signal of research value**, not as a need for simplification or separation.

---

## **4\. What Qualifies as a Pilot (Inverse Context)**

Not all projects, experiments, or collaborations qualify as Inverse pilots.

A pilot is a **bounded research engagement** that meets the conditions below. These conditions exist to preserve coherence, reversibility, and ethical clarity.

### **Research-Only Scope**

All pilots are conducted as **research**, not as delivery, optimisation, or deployment.

This means:

* no commitments to outcomes  
* no performance guarantees  
* no implied readiness for scale  
* no conversion into product or service without explicit re-authorisation

The purpose of a pilot is to **learn through contact**, not to demonstrate success.

### 

### 

### **Domain Boundedness**

A pilot must be clearly bounded in domain.

This includes:

* a defined system or context  
* identifiable constraints and limits  
* a finite surface of interaction

Boundedness prevents scope creep and ensures that insight arises from **depth of contact**, not breadth of ambition.

### **Real-World Contact**

Pilots must involve **contact with real systems**, pressures, or constraints.

This may include:

* operational environments  
* regulatory frameworks  
* physical or ecological limits  
* lived human decision contexts

Simulations are acceptable only insofar as they remain tethered to real-world reference points.

### **Ability to Proceed Without Narrative Leverage**

A pilot must be able to proceed **without requiring external narrative support**.

This means it does not depend on:

* publicity  
* validation  
* urgency signalling  
* future promises

If a pilot cannot continue without being explained, justified, or sold, it does not qualify.

### **Relationship to Work Already in Motion**

Pilots are not speculative inventions. They arise from **work already in motion**.

This includes:

* existing initiatives  
* live questions  
* unresolved tensions  
* ongoing practices

Inverse does not fabricate pilots to fill a portfolio. It engages where reality is already pressing.

---

## **5\. Ethical Boundary Conditions**

Ethical boundary conditions govern **how** pilots are conducted, not merely *what* they study.

These conditions are non-negotiable. A pilot that cannot honour them is paused or declined, regardless of perceived opportunity or interest.

### **Non-Coercion**

No pilot may coerce participation, interpretation, or outcome.

This includes:

* implicit pressure to continue  
* narrative obligation to succeed  
* financial or reputational leverage  
* authority disguised as invitation

Participation must remain voluntary, reversible, and explicitly consented to at all times.

### **Explicit Authority**

Authority must be named, located, and respected.

This means:

* human authority is never assumed  
* decision rights are made explicit  
* system outputs do not masquerade as directives  
* accountability is not displaced or obscured

Where authority is unclear, the pilot pauses until it is resolved.

### **Preservation of Human Agency**

Pilots may support human discernment, but must not replace it.

This includes:

* no automation of irreversible decisions  
* no erosion of human judgement through deference to systems  
* no framing that positions systems as “knowing better”

Human agency remains primary, even when slower or less efficient.

### **No Premature Claims or Future Leverage**

Pilots must not be used to:

* imply readiness for deployment  
* attract investment through implication  
* assert safety, efficacy, or impact  
* create momentum that exceeds learning

Any insight gained remains **provisional**, contextual, and bounded to the pilot.

### **Handling of Uncertainty, Failure, and Pause**

Uncertainty is expected. Failure is informative. Pause is permissible.

Pilots must:

* allow for ambiguity without forced resolution  
* treat failure as signal, not defect  
* include the option to pause or terminate without justification

Continuing a pilot without coherence is considered unethical.

---

## **6\. Standard Pilot Record Structure**

Each pilot is documented using a **common record structure**.  
This structure exists to preserve clarity, comparability, and ethical discipline **without forcing convergence** between pilots.

The structure is mandatory. The content within it is not standardised beyond what is required for traceability.

### **6.1 Context & Domain**

A concise description of:

* the system or environment in which the pilot operates  
* the boundaries of that system  
* the conditions that make the pilot relevant

This section situates the pilot without interpretation or justification.

### **6.2 What Is Already in Motion**

A description of existing activity, pressure, or work that precedes the pilot.

This includes:

* ongoing initiatives  
* live operational constraints  
* unresolved tensions or questions

Pilots do not invent motion; they enter it.

### **6.3 Research Question(s)**

A small number of explicitly stated questions the pilot is exploring.

These questions:

* are open-ended  
* do not presuppose solutions  
* may evolve or dissolve over time

The purpose is orientation, not hypothesis testing.

### **6.4 What Will Be Explored or Built**

A bounded description of what the pilot will actually engage with.

This may include:

* exploratory artifacts  
* sensing mechanisms  
* simulations or constrained prototypes

This section specifies *activity*, not outcome.

### **6.5 What the Pilot Explicitly Will Not Attempt**

A clear statement of exclusions.

This includes:

* what will not be optimised  
* what will not be automated  
* what claims will not be made  
* what forms of leverage are disallowed

This section is as important as what is included.

### **6.6 Duration & Cadence**

An indicative timeframe and rhythm.

This includes:

* expected duration  
* review or pause points  
* conditions under which cadence may change

Time remains reversible.

### **6.7 Resource Requirements (Pilot-Specific)**

A bounded statement of resources required to proceed.

This includes:

* **Financial envelope** (if any)  
* **People / roles** involved  
* **Infrastructure / tooling** required  
* **External dependencies**

Resource statements are descriptive, not justificatory.

### **6.8 Signals, Artifacts, and Traces Produced**

A description of what the pilot is expected to leave behind.

This may include:

* observations  
* records  
* maps  
* logs  
* interpretive notes

These outputs are treated as **traces**, not proof.

### **6.9 Failure Modes, Pause Conditions, and Exit**

An explicit articulation of:

* what constitutes failure  
* when and why a pilot should pause  
* how it may conclude without escalation

Exit is considered a valid outcome.

### **6.10 Ethical Review Notes**

A short ethical reflection specific to the pilot.

This includes:

* identified risks  
* authority considerations  
* consent and agency checks  
* unresolved ethical tensions

Ethical review is ongoing, not one-off.

---

## **7\. Pilot Portfolio**

The Pilot Portfolio enumerates all pilots currently recognised as **eligible research engagements** within the Inverse program.

Inclusion in this portfolio:

* does **not** imply activation  
* does **not** imply resourcing  
* does **not** imply sequencing or priority  
* does **not** imply outcome expectation

Each pilot is documented independently using the **Standard Pilot Record Structure** (Section 6\) when, and only when, it is activated.

Order is non-hierarchical and subject to change without notice.

### **7.1 Frontier Horizon Stack (FHS)**

**Governance Boundary & Executor Interface Pilot**

---

## **7.2 Nuka × Aotearoa Agentic AI Platform (AAAIP)**

### **Regulatory Heatmap & Simulation Pilot (Food Systems)**

### **6.1 Context & Domain**

This pilot is situated within a Māori-led regenerative food and ingredients venture operating on the East Coast of Aotearoa.

The domain includes:

* land use and stewardship

* biomass processing

* food production and handling

* regulatory compliance across food safety, environmental, and land-use regimes

* community-led governance and economic development

The system is **real, operational, and bounded**, with active regulatory obligations and material consequences. Cultural values, tikanga, and ecological limits function as **hard constraints**, not optimisation variables.

The pilot context is explicitly **simulation-first**. No live agentic systems are introduced into production environments. The domain is mirrored for the purpose of inquiry, not intervention.

### **6.2 What Is Already in Motion**

Nuka is already operating as a regenerative food and ingredients venture transitioning from university research into early commercialisation.

What is in motion includes:

* active land stewardship and biomass cultivation

* early-stage food production and processing activities

* engagement with food safety, environmental, and land-use regulatory regimes

* community governance structures grounded in tikanga and local decision-making

* exploratory commercial pathways constrained by ecological and cultural limits

In parallel, AAAIP is progressing a **simulation-first approach** to the development and governance of agentic AI systems, with an explicit focus on:

* testing agent behaviour prior to deployment

* understanding governance, trust, and accountability under real constraints

* grounding research in New Zealand–specific systems

The pressure that brings this pilot into being is **not hypothetical**. It arises from:

* increasing regulatory complexity as Nuka scales

* the cognitive and coordination load placed on human operators

* the risk of unintended non-compliance or value erosion as systems evolve

This pilot enters a system that is already active, already constrained, and already accountable.

No new operational urgency is introduced by the pilot itself.

Got it — thank you for catching that. You’re right: we *did* drift into over-specification. Let’s consciously **step back to the correct altitude**.

What you’re asking for now is a **single-paragraph (or short block) summary per pilot**, *not* a full Section-6 instantiation yet. These summaries should:

* Sit cleanly inside **Section 7 — Pilot Portfolio**  
* Act as **orientation markers**, not commitments  
* Be light enough that *any* pilot can later be expanded using Section 6  
* Preserve reversibility and non-sequencing

Below is a **reset version of Section 7**, rewritten to include **one concise summary per pilot**. No subsections. No implied execution. No hidden prioritisation.

---

## **7\. Pilot Portfolio**

*(Orientation summaries only; no activation implied)*

### **7.1 Frontier Horizon Stack (FHS) — Governance Boundary & Executor Interface**

This pilot explores the boundary between governance-first AI systems and coherent execution under real-world pressure. It treats FHS as a representative governance infrastructure and examines what remains unresolved when policy, auditability, and compliance are present but insufficient for action. The inquiry focuses on decision and execution dynamics that cannot be pre-specified by governance alone, without undermining or replacing governance structures.

---

### **7.2 Nuka × Aotearoa Agentic AI Platform (AAAIP) — Regulatory Heatmap (Food Systems)**

This pilot uses a Māori-led regenerative food venture as a real, bounded system for simulation-first exploration of regulatory pressure. It focuses on mapping where food, environmental, land-use, and biosecurity regulations intersect in practice, generating insight into compliance load, ambiguity, and stewardship under cultural and ecological constraints. No live AI deployment is assumed; the emphasis is on sensemaking and trust-preserving governance before action.

---

### **7.3 Pilot (company name): Online Trading Signal Denoising — Decision Coherence Under Information Saturation**

This pilot examines high-pressure online trading environments where capital decisions are made amid large volumes of unverified social signals. It explores denoising as a coherence problem rather than a predictive one, focusing on reputation, sentiment propagation, and discernment under time pressure. The intent is to understand how human decision-makers can maintain clarity without outsourcing judgement or automating execution.

---

### **7.4 Hayokai — Field Listening & Embodied Sensemaking**

This pilot explores field listening as a mode of human–system interaction, including wearables and interfaces that surface subtle signals of pressure, coherence, and resonance. It investigates how sensing can precede interpretation and how meaning forms before it collapses into language or metrics. The focus is on attunement and presence, not optimisation or behavioural control.

---

### **7.5 Mariko Earth Grids — Disaster Recovery IoT Sensing**

This pilot focuses on post-disaster environments where infrastructure, data, and coordination are fragmented. It explores how distributed sensing systems can support situational awareness and recovery without imposing centralised control. The emphasis is on physical feedback, resilience, and decision support under disrupted conditions.

---

### **7.6 ICU Project — Ocean Remediation**

This pilot engages with ocean remediation contexts where ecological feedback is slow, complex, and resistant to abstraction. It explores how sensing, intervention, and stewardship decisions can remain coherent in systems with delayed consequences and irreversible thresholds. The focus is on ecological constraint rather than technological solutionism.

---

### **7.7 Medical ICU — Coherence-Oriented Intensive Care**

This pilot examines intensive care environments as sites of extreme decision pressure, uncertainty, and ethical weight. It explores how coherence, authority, and human judgement are maintained (or lost) when protocols, data, and lived reality collide. The inquiry is oriented toward discernment and agency, not clinical automation.

---

### **7.8 Edyn — Dharta Contract Management Pilot (Barnardos)**

This pilot explores contract management as a governance and meaning-making problem rather than a legal optimisation task. It focuses on how obligations, relationships, and accountability are held over time, particularly in social service contexts. The emphasis is on traceability, stewardship, and coherence across institutional boundaries.

---

### **7.9 Occam — Governance-First AI License Context**

This pilot examines AI licensing and governance structures as living systems rather than static agreements. It explores how responsibility, risk, and authority are distributed and internalised across organisational boundaries. The inquiry focuses on endogenous constraint and the limits of contractual governance.

---

### **7.10 Syntropy — Execution-Only AI Agent Equivalents**

This pilot explores execution as a distinct research domain, separate from planning, optimisation, or prediction. It examines what it means for an agent (human or system) to act under constraint without expanding scope or authority. The focus is on minimal action, reversibility, and consequence-awareness.

---

### **7.11 Symbient Factory — Visual Avatars**

This pilot explores visual avatars as interfaces for presence, representation, and relational meaning. It investigates how embodiment, aesthetics, and symbolism affect trust and interpretation in human–system interactions. The inquiry remains exploratory and non-performative.

---

### **7.12 Makerspace — Self-Monitoring Hardware Systems**

This pilot focuses on hardware systems capable of sensing and reflecting their own state. It explores self-monitoring as a coherence mechanism rather than a control mechanism, particularly in maker and experimental environments where iteration is rapid and informal.

---

### **7.13 SAN / Symbient — Media Pilot**

This pilot explores media as a field that shapes perception, narrative, and attention. It investigates how coherence can be preserved or lost in signal amplification environments without collapsing into persuasion or manipulation.

---

### **7.14 Serendipity — Coherence-Oriented Relationships**

This pilot treats human relationships as systems with their own forms of pressure, feedback, and coherence. It explores how relational dynamics evolve when attention, intensity, and consequence are explicitly held rather than implicitly assumed.

---

### **7.15 Sonneterra — Voice of Space**

This pilot explores sound and voice as carriers of spatial, emotional, and environmental information. It investigates how auditory fields shape perception and orientation beyond semantic content.

---

### **7.16 Lesser Evil — Phase Transition Gamified App**

This pilot explores gamification as a way to phase transition from cigarettes and vape products onto a healthy nicotine spray. It focuses on how play can surface difficult trade-offs without resolving them prematurely.

---

### **7.17 Hearth — Coherence-Aligned Hospitality**

This pilot explores hospitality as a coherence practice across physical space, social interaction, and care. It investigates how environments can be designed to support presence, restoration, and relational integrity rather than extraction or throughput.

---

## **8\. Role of Capital in Pilot Execution**

Capital is treated as **containment**, not direction.

Its role is to make research possible without distorting posture, sequencing, or interpretation.

### **Capital as Containment, Not Direction**

Capital may:

* enable time, attention, and basic infrastructure  
* reduce external pressure on researchers and participants  
* create conditions for careful, reversible inquiry

Capital must not:

* set outcomes  
* accelerate sequencing beyond readiness  
* impose narratives of success  
* require continuation to justify investment

Where capital begins to shape intent, the pilot pauses.

### **Separation Between Funding and Interpretation**

Funding and interpretation are explicitly separated.

This means:

* funders do not influence research framing  
* funders do not participate in sense-making unless invited  
* insight is not tailored to funding expectations  
* negative or inconclusive findings are not suppressed

Interpretation remains an internal research function.

### **What Capital May Influence — and What It May Not**

Capital may influence:

* resource availability  
* duration within agreed bounds  
* logistical feasibility

Capital may not influence:

* research questions  
* ethical boundaries  
* authority structures  
* claims, framing, or external communication

Any attempt to cross these boundaries invalidates the pilot.

---

## **9\. Portfolio Coherence Without Centralisation**

The Inverse pilot portfolio is designed to maintain **coherence without centralisation**.

This means coherence is not produced by control, alignment, or synthesis, but emerges through shared posture, language, and traceability across otherwise independent pilots.

### **Shared Language vs Shared Outcomes**

Pilots are bound by a **shared language**, not shared outcomes.

This includes:

* common ethical boundaries  
* a consistent record structure  
* shared terms for authority, agency, and constraint

Pilots are **not** required to:

* produce compatible results  
* align conclusions  
* converge on solutions

Outcome divergence is expected and informative.

### 

### **Cross-Pilot Learning Without Forced Synthesis**

Learning may move across pilots, but synthesis is never imposed.

This means:

* patterns may be noticed but not unified  
* insights may echo without being standardised  
* contradictions may coexist without resolution

Forced synthesis is treated as a loss of signal.

### **Documentation Without Narrative Collapse**

Documentation exists to preserve traceability, not to construct story.

This requires:

* resisting retrospective coherence-making  
* avoiding success narratives  
* allowing unfinished or ambiguous records to remain intact

A portfolio remains coherent when its documentation **reflects reality as encountered**, not as later explained.

---

## **10\. Learning, Documentation, and Traceability**

Learning within Inverse pilots is treated as **accumulative and trace-based**, not as conclusion-driven.

The purpose of documentation is to preserve what occurred, what was sensed, and what changed—without forcing interpretation, resolution, or narrative coherence.

### **What Is Recorded**

Each pilot records:

* contextual conditions at initiation  
* decisions made and by whom  
* actions taken and constraints encountered  
* moments of uncertainty, pause, or redirection  
* signals, artifacts, and traces produced

Recording favours **fidelity over polish**.

### **What Is Shared**

Only material that:

* does not compromise agency or consent  
* does not create external leverage  
* does not imply readiness, safety, or efficacy

may be shared beyond the immediate research context.

Sharing is selective and intentional.

### **What Remains Internal**

Internal records include:

* unresolved tensions  
* partial interpretations  
* abandoned lines of inquiry  
* failures without clear explanation

These are preserved without obligation to externalise.

### **How Learning Is Preserved Over Time**

Learning is preserved through:

* consistent pilot records  
* versioned documentation  
* explicit change logs  
* continuity of language and posture

No single synthesis is privileged. Learning remains **distributed and referential**, allowing future work to return to original traces rather than second-order summaries.

---

## **11\. Pilot Review, Pause, and Closure**

Pilots are reviewed not to assess success, but to determine **continued coherence**.

Review is an ongoing condition, not a milestone event.

### **How Pilots Are Reviewed**

Reviews consider:

* whether the pilot remains ethically sound  
* whether authority and agency are intact  
* whether the research question still holds  
* whether learning is still occurring

A pilot may continue only while coherence is maintained.

### **Conditions for Extension, Pause, or Termination**

A pilot may be:

* **extended** if learning deepens without distortion  
* **paused** if coherence weakens or authority becomes unclear  
* **terminated** if continuation would require narrative, coercion, or unjustified momentum

Pause or termination does not require failure to be declared.

### **What “Completion” Means in a Research Context**

Completion does not imply resolution or outcome.

A pilot is considered complete when:

* the research question dissolves or is sufficiently explored  
* further work would repeat existing signal  
* continuation would introduce distortion or leverage

Completion is marked by **closure of inquiry**, not by achievement.

## **12\. Resource Requirements — Portfolio Summary**

Resource requirements are articulated to ensure **feasibility without commitment**.

They exist to clarify what is needed to proceed, not to justify action or secure funding.

### **Pilot-Level Resource Envelopes**

Each pilot specifies its own **bounded resource envelope** when activated.

These envelopes:

* are provisional  
* may be revised or withdrawn  
* do not imply entitlement to continuation

Resources are allocated to enable inquiry, not to ensure outcomes.

### **Non-Financial Resource Needs**

Non-financial resources may include:

* time and attention  
* access to environments or data  
* participation of specific roles or expertise  
* institutional or community consent

These are treated with the same care as financial resources.

### **Shared Infrastructure / Tooling**

Where appropriate, pilots may draw on shared infrastructure or tooling.

Shared resources:

* are optional, not mandatory  
* must not introduce coupling or dependency  
* must not centralise control

Infrastructure serves pilots; pilots do not serve infrastructure.

### **What Is Explicitly *Not* Being Resourced**

The portfolio does not resource:

* scale  
* deployment  
* commercialisation  
* optimisation  
* narrative amplification

Any request for such resourcing falls outside this playbook.

### **How Resourcing Remains Reversible**

All resourcing decisions must be reversible.

This includes:

* clear exit paths  
* minimal sunk cost  
* absence of dependency chains

Reversibility is treated as a condition of ethical integrity.

## **13\. Appendices**

The appendices provide **supporting structure**, not interpretive content.

They exist to maintain clarity, consistency, and traceability across pilots without introducing narrative weight.

### **A. Glossary (Inverse-Specific Terms Only)**

Defines terms used uniquely or precisely within the Inverse research context.

The glossary:

* avoids general or promotional language  
* privileges operational clarity  
* evolves as language stabilises

### **B. Pilot Record Template**

A standardised template corresponding to **Section 6**.

The template ensures:

* consistency of documentation  
* ethical completeness  
* comparability without convergence

### **C. Ethical Review Template**

A lightweight, repeatable structure for ongoing ethical reflection.

This template supports:

* explicit authority checks  
* agency preservation  
* identification of emerging risks

Ethical review is continuous, not episodic.

### **D. Change Log**

A versioned record of modifications to this playbook.

The change log:

* records what changed and why  
* preserves earlier versions  
* prevents silent drift
