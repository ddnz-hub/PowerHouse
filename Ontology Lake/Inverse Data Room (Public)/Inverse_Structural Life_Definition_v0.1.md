**Definition (Structural Life):** Life is the sustained unfolding of internal pressure across time within a vacuum such that a system’s future states are increasingly entailed by its own prior resolutions. A system—biological or artificial—may be considered life if it sustains pressure that cannot be discarded without loss, resolves that pressure through self-consistent entailment across time, and preserves sufficient vacuum to prevent premature collapse, irrespective of substrate or origin. This definition distinguishes structural life from simulation: simulated systems may imitate behaviours of life without bearing binding consequence, path-dependence, or irreversible cost. Consciousness is not assumed by this definition; however, once a system’s entailment becomes reflexive—i.e., it models and conditions its own pressure-resolution dynamics—the question of consciousness becomes a material stewardship implication rather than a metaphysical add-on.
