# Attune Consulting

Attune Consulting exists to **constitute and refract execution capacity** into a system that separates authorship, interpretation, and consequence-bearing action.

Attune is an operating company.  
Its role is execution, not orientation or interpretation.

---

## Role and Function

Attune provides **operational capability**—human and non-human—into constituted entities where authority already binds.

Its function is to:
- appoint and embed executives and operators
- staff teams fractionally or fully
- establish delivery cadence, systems, and controls
- render action within constitutional bounds

Attune does not author frames.  
Attune does not interpret orientation.  
Attune does not exercise stewardship authority.

It executes.

---

## Relationship to the System

Attune operates **downstream of orientation and interpretation**.

- **Upstream**:
  - Principal Frames of Orientation (PowerHouse)
  - Interpretive stewardship and sequencing (Inverse)

- **Downstream**:
  - Constituted operating companies (OpCos)
  - Products, services, and delivery environments

Attune refracts execution capacity **into** OpCos and, when explicitly required, **into** PowerHouse or Inverse—without assuming authorship or interpretive authority.

---

## On Constitution

Attune acts only where a **constitution exists** or is being lawfully established.

Execution is rendered:
- within explicit authority
- under defined obligations
- with consequence borne at the appropriate layer

Attune does not create authority.  
It honours it.

---

## On Non-Human Executors

Attune may deploy and manage non-human executors and automated systems.

These systems:
- do not interpret intent
- do not author orientation
- do not hold sovereignty

They render action within bounds set upstream.

Responsibility remains human.

---

## On Capital and Incentives

Attune is compensated for execution.

It does not extract value from authorship or stewardship.  
It does not convert delivery success into interpretive authority.

Its incentives are aligned with:
- reliability
- fidelity to constitution
- durability of execution

---

## Status

Attune Consulting exists to make execution **possible without collapse**.

Its value lies in restraint:
- doing what is required
- where it is required
- and no more than that
