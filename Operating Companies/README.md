# Operating Companies

This folder contains **constituted operating companies**.

Operating companies are the layer at which authority binds, obligations attach, and consequence is borne. They exist to act in reality—transactionally, legally, and operationally—within bounds set upstream.

Nothing in this folder authors orientation or interprets intent.

## What Lives Here

Operating companies fall into two complementary roles:

- **Product / Market Entities**  
  Companies constituted to commercialise products and services under a binding constitution.

- **Execution & Refractive Entities**  
  Companies constituted to supply execution capacity into other operating companies without assuming authorship or stewardship.

## Relationship to the System

- **Upstream**:
  - Principal Frames of Orientation (PowerHouse)
  - Interpretation and stewardship (Inverse)

- **Here**:
  - Constituted entities
  - Binding authority
  - Consequence-bearing action

Operating companies are permitted confidence because authority has already been settled.

## Status

This folder represents **reality-facing entities**.

If a document belongs upstream of consequence, it does not belong here.
