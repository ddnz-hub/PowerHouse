# Field-Native AI — Data Room Index (Lineage First)

This index exists to make artefact lineage explicit and to prevent narrative theatre.

If a document cannot be placed cleanly in the lineage, it should be treated as **source material** (not canonical).

---

## 0. Canonical spine (authoritative)

- `Operating Companies/Field-Native AI/Constitution.md`

Derived projections (must not contradict the spine):

- `Operating Companies/Field-Native AI/One-Pager.md`
- `Operating Companies/Field-Native AI/Pitch Deck (Document).md`

---

## 1. Closest upstream grounding inside this repo (source material)

These documents contain the most direct, inspectable grounding for the constitutional claims:

- `Ontology Lake/Inverse_Investor Memorandum_v0.1.md`
- `Ontology Lake/Edyn_White Paper_v0.1.md`

## 1.1 Research artefacts (recontextualised into markdown)

These research papers were originally present as PDFs and have been **recontextualised into markdown** in this folder so they can be inspected, cited, and versioned without relying on PDF artefacts.

Research folder (current canonical location for these rewrites):

- `Operating Companies/Field-Native AI/research/`
  - `Operating Companies/Field-Native AI/research/Risk Research/`  
  - `Operating Companies/Field-Native AI/research/Market Research/`  

Direct links (non‑canonical research; included as source material):

## 3. Separation-of-layers reminder

This repo’s layer separation applies here:

- **PowerHouse**: Principal Frames (orientation; no interpretation, no execution)
- **Inverse**: stewardship and interpretation (sequencing, constraint, revocation; non-executing)
- **Field-Native AI (this folder)**: constituted OpCo (execution under constraint; consequence-bearing)
- **Attune Consulting**: execution interface (no ontology / truth authority)
