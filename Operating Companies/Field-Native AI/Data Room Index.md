# Field-Native AI — Data Room Index (Lineage First)

This index exists to make artefact lineage explicit and to prevent narrative theatre.

If a document cannot be placed cleanly in the lineage, it should be treated as **source material** (not canonical).

---

## 0. Canonical spine (authoritative)

- `Operating Companies/Field-Native AI/Constitution.md`

Derived projections (must not contradict the spine):

- `Operating Companies/Field-Native AI/One-Pager.md`
- `Operating Companies/Field-Native AI/Pitch Deck (Document).md`

---

## 1. Closest upstream grounding inside this repo (source material)

These documents contain the most direct, inspectable grounding for the constitutional claims:

- `Ontology Lake/Inverse_Investor Memorandum_v0.1.md`
- `Ontology Lake/Edyn_White Paper_v0.1.md`

---

## 1.1 Research artefacts (recontextualised into markdown)

The research corpus has been consolidated into a single recontextualised white paper for this folder.

Research folder (current canonical location):

- `Operating Companies/Field-Native AI/research/Inverse_White Paper_Reflexive Entailmentv0.1.md`

## 2. Field-Native “public data room” artefacts (current location)

Current source location (to be recontextualised into a pitch-ready canonical structure):

- `Ontology Lake/Field-Native Data Room (Public)/`

## 3. Separation-of-layers reminder

This repo’s layer separation applies here:

- **PowerHouse**: Principal Frames (orientation; no interpretation, no execution)
- **Inverse**: stewardship and interpretation (sequencing, constraint, revocation; non-executing)
- **Field-Native AI (this folder)**: constituted OpCo (execution under constraint; consequence-bearing)
- **Attune Consulting**: execution interface (no ontology / truth authority)
