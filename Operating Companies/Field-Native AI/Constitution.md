## Constitution of Field-Native AI (Canonical)

This document is the **constitutional spine** for Field-Native AI.

Every other artefact (one-pager, pitch deck, data room materials, delivery interfaces) is a **projection** of this spine and must not contradict it.

---

## I. Purpose (What This Is)

Field-Native AI is not a system that produces answers.

Field-Native AI is an intelligence substrate whose purpose is:

- to preserve **epistemic fidelity under scale**
- by ensuring that **implication** unfolds only under **explicit frames**
- with **provenance**, **boundary**, **contradiction**, and **uncertainty** intact

This is an architectural claim, not a metaphysical one.

The system exists to prevent collapse, not to accelerate outcomes.

---

## II. Core Non‑Negotiables (What It Refuses)

Field-Native AI refuses to:

- assert truth without declared frames
- collapse uncertainty for the sake of fluency
- smooth contradiction to preserve coherence
- act without entailment sufficient to justify action under the declared frame
- allow models, parameters, or speed to become epistemic authority
- optimise outcomes at the expense of derivational integrity

These refusals are **structural**. They are not ethical preferences and they are not negotiable under success.

---

## III. Definition of Intelligence (Foundational Claim)

**Intelligence is the faithful unfolding of implication under declared frames.**

From this definition follow the primary architectural consequences:

- holding before action
- latency as an epistemic signal
- silence / refusal as correct behaviour
- action gating as structural ethics (i.e., ethics expressed as architecture, not aspiration)

Nothing downstream may violate this definition without reintroducing optimisation-native collapse.

---

## IV. Governance & Custody (Where Authority Resides)

Authority in Field-Native AI does **not** reside in:

- models, weights, or parameters
- outputs or fluency
- operators
- capital
- interfaces

Authority resides only in:

- explicit frames
- entailment / derivation that is inspectable
- declared boundaries
- provenance (what is being relied on, and what is not)
- contradiction visibility (not contradiction removal)

Custody is therefore:

- epistemic, not operational
- structural, not discretionary
- upstream of product and capital

This is what makes the system governable under pressure.

---

## V. Role of Models (Explicit Demotion)

Parametric models are permitted only as **proposers**.

They may:

- generate hypotheses
- suggest candidate frames
- translate between representations
- explore possibility space

They may never:

- assert truth
- resolve contradiction
- trigger execution
- substitute probability for derivation

This demotion is absolute and non-reversible.

---

## VI. Economics (Boundary Conditions)

Money may:

- fund stewardship
- support development
- resource articulation and documentation
- enable deployment only after constraint is demonstrated

Money may not:

- redefine intelligence
- pressure urgency
- override entailment gates
- purchase authority over truth
- collapse authorship or custody into execution

Capital is downstream of coherence or it is incoherent.

---

## VII. Evolution & Amendment (How It Changes Without Betrayal)

Field-Native AI may evolve only if:

- the core definition of intelligence remains unchanged
- entailment remains primary over optimisation
- frames remain explicit and inspectable
- models remain non-authoritative
- action remains gated by derivation

Any change that violates these is not evolution. It is regression to optimisation-native collapse.

---

## Appendix A — Inheritance Map (What Must Nest)

### A1. Attune Consulting (Execution Interface)

Attune may inherit:

- epistemic posture (non-authoritarian, non-hype)
- refusal of premature closure
- separation of roles and authority

Attune must not inherit:

- ontological authority
- claims of intelligence
- ownership of the substrate

Attune is an execution interface, not a source of truth.

### A2. Pitch Deck (Document)

The pitch deck must:

- describe the problem as collapse under scale
- position the solution as structural inversion (implication before action)
- frame product as evidence, not promise
- demote AGI / metaphysical narratives explicitly

It must never:

- lead with product
- imply inevitability
- trade clarity for excitement

### A3. One-Pager

The one-pager compresses:

- purpose
- inversion
- governance claim
- invitation to diligence

It must invite inspection, not belief.

### A4. Data Room

The data room must:

- show artefact lineage
- make assumptions explicit
- surface boundaries
- avoid narrative theatre

Correct investor feeling:

- “This either holds or it doesn’t — and I can tell which.”

## Grounding (existing sources inside this repo)

This spine is consistent with and grounded in:

- `Ontology Lake/Inverse_Investor Memorandum_v0.1.md` (Field-Native AI definition, governance wedge, action gating/refusal, structural separation)
- `Ontology Lake/Edyn_White Paper_v0.1.md` (coherence sensing posture; demotion of authority; refusal/termination conditions)
