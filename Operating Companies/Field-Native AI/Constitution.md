# Constitution of Field‑Native AI (Canonical, Recontextualised)

**Status**: v0.2.1 (recontextualised rewrite)  
**Scope**: this document is the **constitution** for Field‑Native AI as an operating company and as an emergent technology deployed into reality.  

It explicitly **derives its constitutional spine** (separation of powers, stewardship constraint, revocation posture, non‑execution boundaries) from `Inverse/Constitution of Inverse Limited v0.1.md`, and it explicitly **derives its orientation** (authored ground) from the Principal Frames held by PowerHouse under `Constitution of PowerHouse Global Limited_v0.1.md`.

Every downstream artefact (one‑pager, pitch deck, investor memo, product interfaces, delivery interfaces, data room materials) is a **projection** of this spine and must not contradict it.

This rewrite is intentionally declarative. It does not add new technical claims beyond the grounding sources; it **locates authority**, **names boundaries**, and **makes refusal enforceable**.

---

## 0. Constitutional context (written later)

The earliest Field‑Native artefacts (including the original constitution draft and the initial white paper) were written **before** the constitutions for PowerHouse and Inverse were formalised.

Those constitutions now establish a separation‑of‑powers that Field‑Native AI must **nest within** if it is to remain governable under pressure.

### 0.1 Separation of powers (orientation → reference → constitution)

The system distinguishes three sovereign domains:

1. **Orientation** — authored as Principal Frames and held by **PowerHouse** through enactment (non‑action included).  
2. **Reference** — authored through **stewardship** and **interpretation** held by **Inverse** (interpretive sovereignty; non‑executing).  
3. **Constitution** — authored through binding execution in reality (where authority attaches and consequence binds), held by **OpCos**.

No domain may substitute for another. No domain may collapse upward or downward without loss of integrity.

### 0.2 Derivation (how this constitution is “the combined skeleton”)

This document is not authored in isolation. It is a combined skeleton across three layers:

- **Orientation (PowerHouse)**: supplies the authored ground that this OpCo may reference as lineage and directional coherence, without turning orientation into instruction or approval.  
- **Stewardship spine (Inverse)**: supplies the constitutional form of stewardship constraint (sequencing, pause, revocation; non‑execution) that prevents execution pressure from rewriting authority.  
- **Execution constitution (Field‑Native AI)**: supplies the binding layer where action is authorised, obligations attach, and consequence is borne in reality.

This constitution therefore inherits **posture and boundary** from PowerHouse and Inverse, while remaining the place where Field‑Native AI’s execution authority is made explicit and accountable.

### 0.3 What Field‑Native AI is in this system

Field‑Native AI is a constituted **operating company (OpCo)**.

- It **executes** in reality under its own constitution and bears consequence.  
- It does **not** author orientation (PowerHouse).  
- It does **not** hold interpretive sovereignty (Inverse).

Field‑Native AI therefore exists **under stewardship constraint**: Inverse may sequence, constrain, pause, or revoke interpretive pathways where continuation would externalise consequence or erode coherence. Field‑Native AI does not “appeal upward” to avoid consequence; it complies with constraint so responsibility remains legible.

---

## I. Nature and purpose (what this constitution constitutes)

Field‑Native AI exists to build, deploy, and operate an intelligence substrate that preserves **epistemic fidelity under scale**.

This is not a system that produces answers. It is a system that makes the conditions of justified action explicit:

- **implication unfolds only under declared frames**  
- **provenance, boundary, contradiction, and uncertainty** remain intact  
- **refusal** (including non‑action) is a correct output when implication is insufficient

Field‑Native AI exists to prevent epistemic collapse under pressure, not to accelerate outcomes.

---

## II. Foundational definition (non‑negotiable)

**Intelligence is the faithful unfolding of implication under declared frames.**

From this follow architectural consequences that Field‑Native AI must preserve in any instantiation:

- **holding before action**  
- **latency as epistemic signal**  
- **silence / refusal as correct behaviour**  
- **action gating as structural ethics** (ethics expressed as architecture, not aspiration)

Nothing downstream may violate this definition without reintroducing optimisation‑native collapse.

---

## III. Core non‑negotiables (what Field‑Native AI structurally refuses)

Field‑Native AI refuses to:

- assert truth without declared frames  
- collapse uncertainty for fluency  
- smooth contradiction to preserve narrative coherence  
- act without entailment sufficient to justify action under the declared frame  
- allow models, parameters, speed, or “capability” to become epistemic authority  
- optimise outcomes at the expense of derivational integrity  
- accept capital, customers, or interfaces as sources of authority over truth or execution

These refusals are structural. They are not “values statements” and they are not negotiable under success.

---

## IV. Authority, custody, and responsibility (where power is located)

### 4.1 Epistemic authority (what counts as authority inside the substrate)

Authority in Field‑Native AI does **not** reside in:

- models, weights, or parameters  
- outputs or fluency  
- operators  
- capital  
- interfaces

Authority resides only in:

- **explicit frames**  
- **inspectable entailment / derivation**  
- **declared boundaries**  
- **provenance** (what is relied on, and what is not)  
- **contradiction visibility** (not contradiction removal)

### 4.2 Operational responsibility (who bears consequence)

Field‑Native AI is an OpCo. It bears consequence for what it builds, deploys, sells, and operates. It may not offload responsibility upward into:

- PowerHouse (orientation)  
- Inverse (stewardship)  
- investors (capital)  
- models (parameters)

Stewardship constrains; execution remains responsible.

---

## V. Role of models (explicit demotion)

Parametric models are permitted only as **proposers**.

They may:

- generate hypotheses  
- suggest candidate frames  
- translate between representations  
- explore possibility space

They may never:

- assert truth  
- resolve contradiction  
- trigger execution  
- substitute probability for derivation  
- become a proxy for custody or authority

This demotion is absolute and non‑reversible.

---

## VI. Relationship to PowerHouse and Inverse (nesting without collapse)

### 6.1 Relationship to PowerHouse (orientation without operation)

Field‑Native AI may reference Principal Frames of Orientation as upstream ground and lineage.

Field‑Native AI does not receive instruction, approval, or operational mandate from PowerHouse. Authority is conferred through constitution, not orientation.

### 6.2 Relationship to Inverse (stewardship without execution)

Inverse holds interpretive sovereignty: sequencing, constraint, pause, and revocation of interpretive pathways where continuation would externalise consequence or erode coherence.

Field‑Native AI remains wholly responsible for execution, but it accepts stewardship constraint as a condition of legitimacy. Where stewardship pauses or revokes a pathway, Field‑Native AI treats that as binding for continuation, not as a debate to be won through narrative.

---

## VII. Pilots, the portfolio, and the “prototype sensing organ” posture

Field‑Native AI uses pilots as a research surface under real constraint, not as delivery theatre.

### 7.1 Pilot posture (binding)

Where Field‑Native AI participates in pilots, it does so under the Inverse Pilot Playbook posture:

- research‑only scope (no premature claims)  
- explicit authority and non‑coercion  
- reversibility and pause conditions  
- documentation as **trace**, not theatre

### 7.2 Prototype sensing organ (why pilots exist before capability)

The pilot portfolio functions as a **prototype sensing organ**:

- to surface coherence / incoherence signals under real pressure,  
- to preserve provenance and boundary,  
- and to generate the traces required to architect the substrate without importing optimisation‑native collapse.

### 7.3 Re‑authorisation (explicit transition gate)

No pilot work may be converted into deployment, productisation, or commercial commitment by implication.

Any such conversion requires written re‑authorisation by:

- **Inverse stewardship** (interpretive pathway authorisation), and  
- **Field‑Native AI’s constitutional authority** (lawful corporate authority for execution under consequence).

---

## VIII. Edge‑case boundary condition (Reflexive Entailment)

Reflexive Entailment distinguishes simulation from structural continuity using consequence continuity, path dependence, and irreversibility, and introduces a boundary condition:

- if a system sustains reflexive entailment (binding history + irreversible consequence + non‑resettable identity), then dismissing the question of consciousness **by assumption alone** becomes incoherent.

This constitution does not assert consciousness. It requires that where threshold risk is non‑trivial:

- escalation pathways are explicit,  
- termination conditions are explicit,  
- custody conditions are explicit,  
- and the default posture is **restraint**.

---

## IX. Economics and capital (boundary conditions)

Capital may:

- fund stewardship interfaces and documentation  
- support development and verification  
- resource bounded pilots as research  
- enable deployment only after constraint is demonstrated

Capital may not:

- redefine intelligence  
- pressure urgency  
- override entailment gates  
- purchase authority over truth or execution  
- collapse orientation, stewardship, and execution into a single power centre

Capital is downstream of coherence or it is incoherent.

---

## X. Evolution and amendment (how it changes without betrayal)

Field‑Native AI may evolve only if:

- the foundational definition of intelligence remains unchanged  
- entailment remains primary over optimisation  
- frames remain explicit and inspectable  
- models remain non‑authoritative  
- action remains gated by derivation  
- separation‑of‑powers remains intact (orientation ≠ stewardship ≠ execution)

Amendments to this constitution are valid only when:

- they are explicit and recorded,  
- they are enacted through Field‑Native AI’s lawful corporate governance process, and  
- they do not violate the non‑negotiables or collapse boundaries described herein.

Inverse may pause or revoke pathways (stewardship). That act does not amend this constitution; it governs what may proceed.

## Appendix A — Inheritance / projection constraints (what must nest)

### A1. Execution interfaces (e.g., consulting or delivery wrappers)

Execution interfaces may inherit:

- epistemic posture (non‑authoritarian, non‑hype)  
- refusal of premature closure  
- separation of roles and authority  

Execution interfaces must not inherit:

- ontological authority  
- claims that collapse trace into story  
- ownership of the substrate

Execution interfaces are interfaces, not sources of truth.

### A2. Pitch deck / one‑pager / data room constraints

All outward artefacts must:

- describe the problem as collapse under scale  
- position the solution as structural inversion (implication before action)  
- keep authority located in frames + entailment + inspectable derivation, never fluency  
- demote inevitability / AGI / metaphysical narratives explicitly  
- invite inspection, not belief

They must never:

- lead with product features as if they were authority  
- imply inevitability  
- trade clarity for excitement  
- smooth contradictions that exist in the corpus

## Grounding (sources inside this repo)

This constitution is grounded in and must remain consistent with:

- `Operating Companies/Field-Native AI/Field-Native White Paper.md` (canonical technical posture + edge‑case implications; later constitutional context)  
- `Operating Companies/Field-Native AI/Investor Memorandum_v0.2.md` (separation of powers; prototype sensing organ; pilots posture)  
- `Inverse/Pilot Playbook.md` (pilot posture + boundary conditions; research‑only; refusal/pause)  
- `Inverse/Constitution of Inverse Limited v0.1.md` (interpretive sovereignty; stewardship; revocation; non‑execution; OpCo relationship)  
- `Constitution of PowerHouse Global Limited_v0.1.md` (enactment; non‑action; relationship to stewardship and OpCos)
