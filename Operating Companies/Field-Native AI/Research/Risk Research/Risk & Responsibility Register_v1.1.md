# Risk & Responsibility Register v1.1

**Source**: `Risk & Responsibility Register_v1.1.pdf` (converted to markdown)  
**Status**: rewrite for clarity + recontextualisation only; no new claims added.

## 0. Constitutional context (written later)

This research artefact lives downstream of authored orientation and stewardship constraints.

- **Orientation (PowerHouse)**: holds authored ground; does not interpret or execute.  
- **Stewardship (Inverse)**: holds interpretive sovereignty (sequencing, constraint, pause, revocation); non‑executing.  
- **Execution (Field‑Native AI / OpCo)**: executes under constitution, where consequence binds.

This document is included to support **inspectable derivation**, preserve **boundary**, and make **refusal/pause** structurally available under pressure.

### 0.3 Placement in the Field‑Native system

- Defines structural risks of coherence/authority/scale interaction and the constraint posture used to prevent drift.
- Directly supports: **Field‑Native AI Constitution** (Economics/capital boundaries; authority location; refusal/pause as structural).
- Use in data room as: risk framing that is **structural** (not fear‑based) and that preserves separation‑of‑powers.

Risk & Responsibility Register v1.1 

(Triangulated Entailment version — current frame) 

Purpose of this register (updated) 

This document does not catalogue threats to be defended against. 

It names structural risks that emerge when coherence, authority, and scale interact, 
and specifies how Triangulated Entailment prevents collapse without relying on moral virtue, 
heroics, or central control. 

Risk is treated as: 

- a property of context 
- a function of scale 
- and a signal for design constraint 

1. Epistemic Capture (supersedes “Industrial Espionage”) 

Risk 
The extraction, imitation, or re-presentation of outputs without the epistemic frame that 
produced them. 

Failure mode 

- Architecture appears replicated but loses coherence 
- Derivations are replaced with optimisation 
- Authority recentralises through interpretation 

- Mitigation

- Make epistemic posture explicit and inseparable from artefacts 
- Keep derivation upstream of implementation 
- Treat partial imitation as self-limiting rather than threatening 

Entailment principle 
What cannot be derived under frame cannot be meaningfully copied.

2. Capital-Induced Drift (reframes “VC Capture”) 

Risk 
External capital applying pressure to accelerate, simplify, or narrativise before derivation is 
complete. 

Failure mode 

- Speed substitutes for coherence 
- “Integration” replaces re-orientation 
- Governance erodes under urgency 

- Mitigation

- Constitutional gating of execution 
- Clear rejection of capital that requires narrative dominance 
- Preference for capital that tolerates ambiguity and latency 

Entailment principle 
No funding event may outrun epistemic stability. 

3. Infrastructure Coercion 

Risk 
Dependence on platforms whose incentives are misaligned with coherence-preserving 
systems. 

Failure mode 

- Silent access 
- Forced compliance 
- Availability withdrawal at critical moments 

- Mitigation

- Architectural portability 
- Jurisdictional separation 
- Eventual sovereign infrastructure 

Entailment principle 
No single substrate may hold leverage over meaning.

4. Identity & Agency Misattribution 

Risk 
Systems or agents being treated as authorities rather than instruments of discernment. 

Failure mode 

- Projection of agency 
- Over-delegation of judgment 
- Erosion of human accountability 

- Mitigation

- Cryptographic provenance 
- Explicit non-authority constraints 
- Human-in-the-loop by design, not exception 

Entailment principle 
The system may clarify; it may not decide. 

5. Governance Overreach (reframed) 

Risk 
Governance bodies attempting to resolve tension rather than hold it. 

Failure mode 

- Premature closure 
- Authority drift 
- Loss of plural interpretation 

- Mitigation

- Board limited to orientation and tension-naming 
- Executive limited to derivable action 
- Authorship clearly separated from authority 

Entailment principle 
Governance preserves conditions; it does not produce outcomes.

6. Psychological & Social Harm (newly explicit) 

Risk 
Exposure of individuals to gravity they did not consent to or cannot yet metabolise. 

Failure mode 

- Burnout 
- Bitterness 
- Retrospective blame 
- Moral injury 

- Mitigation

- Explicit consent to proximity 
- Gradual disclosure 
- Right to step back without penalty 

Entailment principle 
No one is entitled to another person’s nervous system. 

7. Systemic Dependency 

Risk 
Users deferring their own judgment to the system. 

Failure mode 

- Learned helplessness 
- Over-reliance 
- Loss of agency 

- Mitigation

- Design for rehabilitation, not substitution 
- Progressive hand-back of judgment 
- Graceful degradation 

Entailment principle 
Intelligence that replaces agency is mis-specified.

8. Narrative Collapse (reframes “AGI risk”) 

Risk 
The work being collapsed into speculative or mythic narratives that obscure its actual 
function. 

Failure mode 

- External projection 
- Internal confusion 
- Loss of legitimacy 

- Mitigation

- Refusal to answer the wrong questions 
- Consistent reframing toward conditions, not entities 
- Slow, precise language 

Entailment principle 
We do not claim minds; we preserve conditions. 

Final Constraint (updated) 

No individual, organisation, or system may: 

- centralise epistemic authority 
- coerce interpretation 
- or override derivation with urgency 

Only structure may constrain structure.
