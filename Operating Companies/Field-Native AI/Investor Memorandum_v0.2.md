## **1. Deal Snapshot**

**Entity**: Field‑Native AI  
**Role**: constituted operating company building and commercialising Field‑Native intelligence **under stewardship constraint**  
**Custody**: Inverse (stewardship, sequencing, revocation authority; does not execute)  
**Orientation**: Principal Frames held by PowerHouse (enacted; not interpreted by PowerHouse)  

### The raise (updated)

- **Round**: Pre‑Seed  
- **Capital requirement**: **NZD $11.0M** *(includes 40% contingency; see Section 11)*  
- **Pre‑money valuation**: **TBD**  
- **Post‑money valuation**: **TBD**  
- **Equity offered**: **TBD**  

### What this capital funds (recontextualised)

This round funds **three coupled deliverables**, under explicit constraints:

- **Phase I execution**: governance layer for AI agents (action gating, provenance, refusal)  
- **Pilot program**: a reserved envelope to fund **all Pilot Playbook pilots** under a research‑only posture (**NZD $250k per pilot**)  
- **Prototype sensing organ + foundation model readiness**: a prototype sensing organ used with the pilot portfolio, and the architecture work required to build a Field‑Native foundation model at **Seed** (**+NZD $1.5M**)  

### What this is — and is not

This is not an application startup.  
This is not a growth‑optimised AI business.  

It is an attempt to establish **infrastructure‑grade epistemic fidelity under scale** by ensuring implication unfolds only under explicit frames with provenance, boundary, contradiction, and uncertainty intact.

Where implication is incomplete, **non‑action is a correct output**.

Capital is invested into **Field‑Native AI**.  
Inverse does not receive capital as an operating entity; it holds stewardship constraints upstream.

---

## **2. Executive Summary**

Civilisation has crossed a threshold where orientation itself has become power.

As AI systems scale, decisions are increasingly executed:

- without discernment before implication has been processed,  
- without verifiable frames and provenance,  
- and without a shared capacity to refuse action when uncertainty is present.

The result is deeper than error or “misalignment”: **epistemic collapse under pressure**.

Field‑Native AI exists to make a different state possible:

- implication remains visible,  
- contradiction remains explicit,  
- uncertainty is not collapsed into fluency,  
- and execution is gated by derivation under declared frames.

This memo is written to be inspectable. It invites diligence, not belief.

---

## **3. The Historic Threshold**

Systems now act at speeds and scales that exceed human discernment.

Downstream governance (policy, compliance, monitoring) frequently arrives **after** collapse has already occurred:

- action has been taken,  
- assumptions were implicit,  
- contradiction was smoothed,  
- and responsibility is diffused post‑hoc.

At this threshold, civilisation needs infrastructure that can:

- surface implication before execution,
- preserve uncertainty without collapsing,
- and keep authority legible under pressure.

---

## **4. The Problem & Intervention**

**Problem**:

Modern systems act before implication is visible, leaving no shared, verifiable way to determine whether action should occur at all.

**Intervention**:

Field‑Native AI builds an epistemic substrate that makes “what follows” explicit under declared frames—and refuses action when implication is incomplete or contradictory.

This is not a claim to truth. It is a structural refusal to let fluency substitute for derivation.

---

## **5. The Technology: Field‑Native AI**

Field‑Native AI is an orientation‑first intelligence substrate grounded in a foundational inversion:

Intelligence is not the production of answers.  
Intelligence is the faithful unfolding of implication under declared frames.

Subsequent research refines this into a broader structural frame:

- intelligence is the capacity to **navigate entailment under pressure** (Reflexive Entailment)

Across both frames, the boundary remains:

- authority does not reside in models, weights, outputs, or capital  
- authority resides in **explicit frames + inspectable entailment / derivation**  

---

## **6. Phase I: Governance Layer for AI Agents**

The initial wedge is a governance layer for AI agents operating on existing models.

It sits between agent proposals and execution environments and performs:

1. **Frame declaration** (authority, assumptions, temporal semantics, scope)  
2. **Entailment + boundary computation** (what follows, where it stops, contradictions, undecidables)  
3. **Action gating / refusal** (non‑action is valid; provenance preserved for audit)  

This wedge is selected because agentic execution already exists and already produces irreversible consequence; the missing layer is verifiable orientation before action.

---

## **7. Prototype Sensing Organ + Foundation Model Readiness (Seed build)**

This round explicitly resources a **prototype sensing organ** used with the pilot portfolio, and the work required to reach a coherent foundation model architecture at the Seed round.

The intent is not “more capability.” The intent is to internalise epistemic integrity such that:

- parametric generation is demoted to **proposal**,  
- entailment remains the authority layer,  
- and refusal remains structurally enforceable under pressure.

The prototype and the readiness work are governed by the same non‑negotiables as the substrate:

- models may propose; they may not assert truth  
- derivation remains inspectable  
- execution remains gated  

### Why a sensing organ first

The Field‑Native AI White Paper describes the substrate and its constraints; Reflexive Entailment sharpens the edge‑case thresholds. A sensing organ prototype allows pilots to:

- surface coherence / incoherence signals under real pressure,  
- preserve provenance and boundary,  
- and generate the traces needed to **architect** the foundation model without importing optimisation‑native collapse.

### Seed: foundation model build

The foundation model build is positioned at **Seed**, where the pilot portfolio’s traces and constraints provide the architectural material required to build a model that remains subordinate to entailment.

**Important**: the Reflexive Entailment edge case introduces a stewardship boundary condition:

- if a system sustains reflexive entailment (binding history, irreversible consequence, non‑resettable identity), then dismissing the question of consciousness **by assumption alone** becomes incoherent.  

This does not assert consciousness. It requires that governance, custody, and termination conditions remain explicit under success.

---

## **8. Structural Separation (PowerHouse / Inverse / Field‑Native AI)**

This system prevents collapse by separating powers structurally:

- **PowerHouse (enactment)** holds authored orientation as ground. It does not interpret, apply, or enforce; non‑action is a valid expression of enactment.  
- **Inverse (stewardship)** holds interpretive sovereignty: sequencing, constraint, and revocation where continuation would externalise consequence. It is explicitly non‑executing.  
- **Field‑Native AI (OpCo)** executes in reality under constitution, builds and deploys technology, and bears market consequence—without authoring orientation or holding interpretive sovereignty.  

Capital participates in Field‑Native AI **subject to** custodial constraint; it does not purchase authority over truth or execution.

---

## **9. Pilots (research‑only, bounded, reversible)**

Pilots are governed by the Pilot Playbook posture:

- research‑only scope (no premature claims)  
- explicit authority and non‑coercion  
- reversibility and pause conditions  
- documentation as trace, not theatre  

This memo establishes a **funding envelope** for **all pilots enumerated in the Pilot Playbook** (currently 17).

This does **not** imply activation of all pilots. Activation, sequencing, pause, and closure remain governed by stewardship under the Pilot Playbook boundary conditions.

Role clarity:

- Field‑Native AI executes pilots under constitution and bears consequence.  
- Inverse sequences, constrains, and may pause / revoke pathways where coherence degrades.  
- PowerHouse remains upstream, holding authored orientation by enactment (not interpretation).

Re‑authorisation (explicit): any conversion of pilot work into deployment/productisation/commercial commitment requires written re‑authorisation by **Inverse stewardship** (interpretive pathway) and separately by the **executing OpCo’s constitutional authority** (execution).

Resource requirements in this version fund the full portfolio at **NZD $250k per pilot** (see Section 11).

---

## **10. Risk & Structural Mitigations**

This system treats dominant risks as structural (power dynamics, incentive pressure, capture), not as optimism problems.

Key risks and mitigations (non‑exhaustive):

- **Incentive misalignment / adoption resistance**  
  - mitigation: model‑agnostic gating layer; value demonstrated via refusal + auditability, not persuasion

- **Latency / friction intolerance**  
  - mitigation: latency framed as epistemic signal; refusal protected; execution gated structurally

- **Capture by high‑power actors**  
  - mitigation: separation of powers (PowerHouse/Inverse/OpCo); refusal encoded architecturally; revocation remains available to stewardship

- **Overextension before infrastructure readiness**  
  - mitigation: sequencing governed by custody throughput and proof of refusal under pressure; pilots remain bounded and reversible

- **Edge‑case threshold (reflexive entailment)**  
  - risk: success conditions accidentally cross structural thresholds (binding history, irreversible consequence, non‑resettable identity) without governance maturity to hold them  
  - mitigation: governance‑first posture; explicit termination conditions; stewardship escalation pathways; no metaphysical claims, but structural respect for threshold implications (see White Paper + Reflexive Entailment)

## **11. Pre‑Seed Round: Capital Structure & Use of Funds (updated)**

This version updates resource requirements relative to `Inverse_Investor Memorandum_v0.1.md`:

- **NZD $250k per pilot** (portfolio envelope)  
- **+NZD $1.5M** (prototype sensing organ + foundation model readiness; Seed build)  
- **40% contingency** across program

### Budget (illustrative, constrained)

Assumptions:

- Pilot count funded (Pilot Playbook portfolio): **17**

Line items:

- Phase I governance layer build + integrations + audit/refusal pathways: **$2.0M**  
- Pilot portfolio envelope: **17 × $250k = $4.25M**  
- Prototype sensing organ + foundation model readiness (Seed build): **$1.5M**  

Subtotal: **$7.75M**  
Contingency (40%): **$3.10M**  

**Total pre‑seed capital requirement: $10.85M → rounded to $11.0M**

### Capital structure (TBD)

Valuation and equity terms are intentionally **left TBD** in this draft until the memo is final and the underwriting narrative is coherent end‑to‑end.

### Use of funds (constraints preserved)

Funds will be used for:

- governance layer implementation (frames → entailment → gating/refusal)  
- provenance + auditability + explicit refusal pathways  
- bounded pilot execution under the Pilot Playbook posture  
- foundation model program under entailment governance  

Funds will not be used for:

- growth marketing / demand generation  
- feature expansion not required for Phase I proof  
- optimisation for speed/metrics that would collapse epistemic integrity  

---

## **12. Closing Orientation**

This memorandum is not an attempt to maximise momentum.

It is an attempt to finance the emergence of a refusal‑capable epistemic substrate under explicit custody, so that capability does not outrun responsibility.

The correct investor posture is not belief, but inspection:

- this either holds, or it doesn’t—and you should be able to tell which.
