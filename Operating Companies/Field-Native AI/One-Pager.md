# Field-Native AI (One‑Pager)

## What This Is

Field-Native AI is not a system that produces answers.

It is an intelligence substrate designed to preserve **epistemic fidelity under scale** by ensuring implication unfolds only under explicit frames, with provenance, boundary, contradiction, and uncertainty intact.

This is an architectural claim, not a metaphysical one.

## The Inversion

**Intelligence is the faithful unfolding of implication under declared frames.**

From this follow:

- holding before action
- latency as epistemic signal
- silence / refusal as correct behaviour
- action gating as structural ethics

## Where Authority Resides

Authority does not reside in models, weights, outputs, operators, capital, or interfaces.

Authority resides only in:

- explicit frames
- inspectable derivation / entailment
- declared boundaries
- provenance and contradiction visibility

## What It Refuses

Field-Native AI refuses to:

- assert truth without declared frames
- collapse uncertainty for fluency
- smooth contradiction
- act without entailment sufficient to justify action
- allow speed or parameters to become epistemic authority
- optimise outcomes at the expense of derivational integrity

These refusals are structural.

## Invitation to Diligence

This either holds or it doesn’t — and you should be able to tell which.
