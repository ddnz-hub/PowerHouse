# Field-Native AI — Pitch Deck (Document)

This is a **deck-as-document**: a restrained, inspectable projection of the canonical spine in `Constitution.md`.

It is designed to prevent narrative drift.

---

## Non‑negotiable posture

The deck must:

- describe the problem as **collapse under scale**
- position the solution as a **structural inversion** (implication before action)
- frame the Phase I wedge as **evidence** (refusal + gating under pressure), not promise
- demote AGI / consciousness / inevitability narratives explicitly
- keep authority located in **frames + entailment + inspectable derivation**, never fluency

The deck must not:

- lead with product features
- trade clarity for excitement
- smooth contradictions that exist in the corpus
- imply destiny, inevitability, or metaphysical claims

If a claim cannot be derived from sources, it must be marked **“cannot be derived”** or omitted.

## Slide spine (suggested)

1. **Title / posture**
   - Field-Native AI as epistemic infrastructure; restraint as design

2. **The threshold**
   - Systems act before implication is visible; governance is downstream / too late

3. **The inversion**
   - Intelligence = faithful unfolding of implication under declared frames

4. **What the system refuses**
   - Structural refusals (uncertainty, contradiction, non-action)

5. **Where authority resides**
   - Frames + entailment + derivation; not models/outputs/capital

6. **Phase I wedge**
   - Governance layer for AI agents: frame declaration → entailment surface → action gating/refusal

6b. **Prototype sensing organ (why pilots)**
   - Use the Pilot Playbook portfolio as a sensing organ to surface coherence/incoherence under pressure and generate provenance/boundary traces that inform architecture (without converting pilots into a roadmap).

7. **Why now**
   - Autonomous execution pressure + liability + auditability demands

8. **Structural separation**
   - Custody vs execution vs capital constraints (no purchase of authority)
   - Re‑authorisation clarity: any move from research pilots into deployment/productisation requires written re‑authorisation by **Inverse stewardship** (pathway) and the **OpCo’s constitutional authority** (execution).

9. **Risk & structural mitigations**
   - Capture, incentive misalignment, latency culture, novelty: mitigated structurally (refusal, separation)

10. **Use of funds (constrained)**
   - Build Phase I gating/refusal + provenance/audit pathways; no growth theatre

11. **Diligence invitation**
   - “This either holds or it doesn’t — and you can tell which.”
   - Point to constitution + memo + white paper
