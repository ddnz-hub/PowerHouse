## **Constitution of Inverse Limited v0.1**

## **Section 0 — Preamble**

**Constitution of Inverse**

Inverse exists as a sovereign legal entity constituted to hold **stewardship and interpretation** as explicit, accountable functions.

Inverse does not arise from authority by implication. It is constituted because interpretation, governance, and constraint must be **deliberate, bounded, and responsible** if authored orientation is to enter reality without distortion.

Inverse exists downstream of authored orientation and upstream of execution. It occupies the space where meaning encounters consequence, and where coherence must be actively maintained across time.

The purpose of Inverse is not to originate truth, nor to produce outcomes. Its purpose is to **interpret orientation into reference**, to govern misaligned unfoldment, and to steward the conditions under which execution may lawfully occur.

Stewardship is not a passive role. It requires judgment, refusal, sequencing, and, where necessary, revocation. These acts cannot be left informal, implicit, or distributed without accountability. They must be held by an entity whose mandate is constraint rather than ambition.

Inverse is constituted to:

* interpret authored orientation without rewriting it,  
* govern coherence without asserting originary authority,  
* and enforce alignment at the level of consequence without moralisation.

Research within Inverse is not a means to product or proof. It is a disciplined process of exploration, stress-testing, and unfolding under constraint. Research exists to surface implications, not to resolve them prematurely.

This Constitution establishes Inverse as the lawful steward of interpretation, coherence, and research—so that:

* authorship remains upstream and uncoerced,  
* execution remains downstream and decisive,  
* and responsibility remains legible at every layer.

In constituting itself in this way, Inverse affirms that:

* constraint is a form of care,  
* governance is a form of authorship within bounds,  
* and coherence is preserved not by control, but by principled refusal.

This Preamble establishes the ground upon which all subsequent sections of this Constitution stand.

---

## **Section 1 — Nature of the Entity**

Inverse exists to exercise **stewardship and interpretation** as sovereign, accountable functions.

Inverse is not an authoring entity.  
Inverse is not an operating company.  
Inverse is not an execution body.

It does not originate orientation, pursue markets, develop products, or render outcomes. These activities are intentionally excluded from its nature.

The nature of Inverse is **interpretive and constraining**.

Inverse exists to translate authored orientation into reference—into context, boundaries, sequencing, and governance—so that action may occur downstream without ambiguity or collapse of responsibility.

Interpretation within Inverse is not discovery of truth. It is a bounded form of authorship exercised under responsibility and exposure to consequence. Interpretation shapes pathways without asserting originary authority.

Inverse is neither passive nor neutral. It actively governs coherence by:

* holding constraints where pressure would otherwise collapse judgment,  
* sequencing unfoldment across time,  
* and intervening where misalignment manifests at the level of consequence.

Inverse does not intervene in execution.  
It does not transact.  
It does not manage operations.

Where action is required, Inverse acts through governance mechanisms—authorisation, pause, revocation, or withdrawal of mandate—rather than through direct control.

Inverse exists as a distinct organ within a broader regenerative system. Its function is non-substitutable. Without stewardship, authored orientation would be exposed to misinterpretation or exploitation. With stewardship overreaching, execution would be paralysed or coerced.

Inverse is therefore constituted to remain **bounded, vigilant, and accountable**.

It derives its legitimacy not from outcomes, consensus, or capital, but from fidelity to its role: maintaining coherence between orientation and consequence without collapsing into either.

---

## **Section 2 — Interpretive Sovereignty**

Inverse holds **interpretive sovereignty**.

Interpretive sovereignty is the lawful authority to translate authored orientation into reference: context, boundaries, sequencing, and governance necessary for coherent unfoldment across time. This authority is real, bounded, and accountable.

Interpretation within Inverse is not originary.  
It does not create orientation.  
It does not assert truth.  
It does not compel execution.

Interpretation is a form of authorship exercised **within constraint**.

Inverse interprets authored orientation in response to reality as it is encountered. This includes sensing pressure, identifying incoherence, and establishing the conditions under which downstream constitution and execution may proceed without distortion.

Interpretive sovereignty authorises Inverse to:

* contextualise orientation without rewriting it,  
* sequence unfoldment without accelerating it,  
* establish constraints that protect coherence,  
* and determine when conditions are not yet conducive to action.

Interpretation does not guarantee correctness. It guarantees responsibility.

Inverse is accountable for the consequences of its interpretations at the level where consequence becomes visible. Where interpretation proves misaligned, Inverse bears responsibility to revise reference, impose constraint, or revoke pathways downstream.

Interpretive sovereignty does **not** include:

* enforcement of behaviour,  
* management of operations,  
* optimisation of performance,  
* or substitution for constitution.

Those powers belong elsewhere.

Interpretive sovereignty is exercised in service of **coherence**, not growth. Growth may occur where conditions are conducive. Where growth would erode coherence, interpretation may constrain, pause, or refuse sequencing.

Inverse preserves the conditions under which organic growth may unfold. It does not pursue growth as an objective. It tends the environment so that what grows does so lawfully and without internal contradiction.

By holding interpretive sovereignty in this way, Inverse affirms that:

* orientation may guide without commanding,  
* constraint may protect without dominating,  
* and responsibility may be borne without claiming supremacy.

Interpretive sovereignty is therefore not a license to decide outcomes.  
It is a commitment to hold meaning steady as reality changes.

---

## **Section 3 — Relationship to Orientation (PowerHouse)**

Inverse exists in defined relationship to authored orientation, held upstream by PowerHouse.

This relationship is one of **lineage without dependency** and **reference without control**.

Orientation precedes Inverse.  
Interpretation belongs to Inverse.

Inverse does not author orientation.  
Inverse does not amend orientation.  
Inverse does not enforce orientation.

Authored orientation provides the ground from which interpretation proceeds. It does not instruct, compel, or govern Inverse’s interpretive acts. Orientation orients; it does not decide.

Inverse may reference Principal Frames of Orientation to establish lineage, intent, and directional coherence. Such reference does not constitute approval, obligation, or instruction. Interpretation remains the sovereign responsibility of Inverse.

Inverse does not seek clarification of orientation in order to act. Ambiguity at the level of orientation is not a defect to be resolved upstream. It is a condition to be held interpretively, downstream, with responsibility.

Where interpretation diverges from authored orientation in practice, that divergence is addressed through interpretive revision, constraint, or revocation—not through reinterpretation or amendment of orientation.

Inverse explicitly refuses:

* to treat orientation as policy,  
* to translate orientation into mandates,  
* or to defer interpretive responsibility upward.

PowerHouse does not intervene in interpretation.  
Inverse does not defer to orientation to avoid responsibility.

This mutual restraint preserves sovereignty at both layers.

Orientation influences interpretation without commanding it.  
Interpretation responds to orientation without rewriting it.

By maintaining this relationship, Inverse affirms that:

* authored origin may remain intact without being imposed,  
* interpretation may adapt without becoming originary,  
* and coherence may be preserved without collapsing authority upward or downward.

Inverse stands downstream of orientation and upstream of consequence, accountable for how meaning unfolds without claiming ownership of what was authored.

---

## **Section 4 — Governance and Coherence**

Inverse exercises governance in service of **coherence**.

Governance within Inverse is not managerial, executive, or operational. It is the disciplined practice of constraint: establishing boundaries, sequencing unfoldment, and tending the conditions under which interpretation and execution remain non-contradictory across time.

Coherence is not uniformity.  
Coherence is the absence of internal contradiction between orientation, interpretation, and consequence.

Inverse governs by:

* sensing pressure where misalignment is emerging,  
* identifying pathways where interpretation would collapse under execution,  
* pacing or pausing unfoldment where conditions are not yet conducive,  
* and removing invasive forces that would distort orientation or erode constitutional integrity.

Governance is exercised **before** failure where possible, and **through consequence** where necessary.

Inverse does not govern outcomes.  
It governs conditions.

Inverse does not pursue growth.  
It preserves the conditions under which **organic growth may unfold coherently**.

Where growth emerges as a result of well-tended conditions, it is received. Where growth would compromise coherence—through acceleration, extraction, or consolidation of power—governance constrains, delays, or redirects.

This form of governance recognises that:

* value is preserved more often than it is created,  
* long-term compounding depends on restraint,  
* and not all opportunities should be taken.

Inverse’s governance therefore operates at the **portfolio level**, not by managing entities, but by maintaining environmental integrity across them. This includes preserving option value, preventing destructive coupling, and ensuring that no single success rewrites the conditions for all others.

Governance decisions are accountable. They may be revised in response to consequence. They are not justified by authority, consensus, or capital pressure.

By governing coherence in this way, Inverse affirms that:

* stewardship is active without being invasive,  
* constraint is protective rather than prohibitive,  
* and growth is healthiest when it is allowed, not forced.

Governance is the act of tending the garden so that what grows does so without distortion.

---

## **Section 5 — Revocation and Misaligned Unfoldment**

Inverse holds the authority of **revocation**.

Revocation is the act of withdrawing interpretive pathways, permissions, or mandates when unfoldment becomes misaligned with orientation or incoherent in consequence. It is exercised at the level where consequence is visible and responsibility must be borne.

Revocation is not punishment.  
Revocation is not judgment of intent.  
Revocation is not authorship.

Revocation is a governance act grounded in responsibility to coherence.

Inverse may revoke when:

* interpretation produces persistent contradiction between orientation and outcome,  
* execution amplifies distortion or consolidates power improperly,  
* conditions no longer support lawful or coherent unfoldment,  
* or continuation would externalise harm or obscure accountability.

Revocation may take the form of:

* suspending authorisation,  
* withdrawing stewardship support,  
* pausing or sunsetting initiatives,  
* or formally ending pathways of unfoldment.

Revocation does not amend authored orientation.  
It does not rewrite intent.  
It does not retroactively invalidate prior interpretation or execution.

Revocation addresses **what proceeds**, not **what was authored**.

Inverse does not require certainty to revoke.  
It requires responsibility.

Where revocation occurs, Inverse is accountable for the decision and its consequences. Revocation may later be revised, lifted, or replaced by a different interpretive pathway if conditions change.

Inverse does not moralise misalignment. Divergence is expected in complex systems. Revocation exists so that divergence does not become drift, and drift does not become collapse.

Revocation is exercised with restraint.  
It is not a first response.  
It is not an optimisation tool.

It is a boundary act, taken when continuation would compromise coherence or externalise consequence.

By holding revocation in this way, Inverse affirms that:

* authority must be exercised where consequence lands,  
* protection of the whole may require withdrawal of parts,  
* and coherence is preserved not by insisting on alignment, but by refusing misaligned unfoldment.

Revocation is therefore an act of care, not control.

---

## **Section 6 — Research, Grace, and Entailment-Driven Unfoldment**

Inverse conducts **research** as the living interface between **possibility** and **reality**.

Research exists so that authored conjecture, theory, art, and inspiration may encounter reality **without being forced to become real**, and so that reality may answer back **without erasing authorship**.

Authorship is free to remain speculative.  
Reality is free to refuse.

Research is the act of listening carefully to that refusal.

Nothing is forbidden except extraction that refuses to bear its own consequence.

### **6.1 Research as Hypothesis Testing**

Research within Inverse explicitly **tests hypotheses**.

These hypotheses may originate from:

* academic conjecture,  
* theoretical frameworks,  
* artistic inspiration,  
* speculative models,  
* or Principal Frames of Orientation that have not yet met consequence.

Research seeks to understand:

* what **must be true** for something to live,  
* what **is true now** in the world as it is,  
* and what **could become true** if conditions were changed.

Conclusions are drawn provisionally and responsibly.  
They are not treated as proof.  
They are treated as **signals from reality**.

### **6.2 The Optionality Space**

A core function of research is to map the **entailed optionality space**.

This includes:

* identifying which paths are structurally impossible,  
* which are conditionally viable,  
* and which require environmental change rather than optimisation.

Research distinguishes feasibility from desirability, and possibility from readiness. It clarifies where pressure must be applied, and where restraint must be maintained.

This optionality space informs stewardship decisions about pacing, sequencing, refusal, or progression—but does not compel execution.

### **6.3 Grace as a Structural Property**

Research within Inverse is governed by **grace**, not entitlement.

Authorship is honoured regardless of outcome.  
No author is required to commercialise.  
No idea is obligated to survive.

Meaning is not extracted by default from conjecture, nor assumed as an entitlement. It must be earned through contact with reality and ownership of consequence.

This grace gently dissolves entitlement.  
Nothing is punished for remaining upstream. What compounds downstream does so only where it proves life-sustaining **in context** and under consequence.

### **6.4 The Market as Soil**

Inverse understands the market as **soil**, not as an adversary or judge.

Research therefore includes studying:

* cultural readiness,  
* narrative conditions,  
* economic pressures,  
* timing, trust, and coherence.

Inverse does not default to force or optimisation. It tends conditions first, and intervenes only where context entails that intervention is necessary to sustain life.

When research indicates that conditions are conducive, something may be **planted**. When conditions are not, restraint is the correct response.

Growth, if it occurs, is an emergent property of alignment—not the result of force.

### **6.5 Pressure Back Upstream**

Findings from research may apply **pressure back upstream**.

This pressure does not compel re-authorship.  
It informs it.

Authored orientation may remain unchanged, evolve, or be re-authored in response—but never under coercion. Interpretation remains with Inverse as the **record of what unfolded when possibility met reality**.

The Principal Frame is allowed to be wrong.  
Inverse is required to be honest.

### **6.6 Transition Into Life**

Where research indicates that something can live in reality, stewardship may authorise transition into constitution and execution downstream.

What enters the world must:

* bear consequence,  
* sustain itself,  
* and continue without explanation.

What cannot do so is allowed to remain inspiration.

This distinction protects both art and reality.

### **6.7 Nutrient Return**

Where something becomes life-giving and self-sustaining in the world, a portion of value returns upstream.

This return may include extraction where context entails it, but never without visibility, governance, and consequence. Where extraction occurs, it is treated as nutrient flow only insofar as it sustains the wider system rather than depleting it.

It funds further conjecture, theory, art, and inspiration—expanding the shared possibility space for the entire system.

In this way:

* authors are honoured in perpetuity,  
* meaningless production is not incentivised,  
* and life sustains life.

### **6.8 Collective Intelligence**

The structures of authorship, research, interpretation, and consequence create a **shared field of meaning**.

This field may be held, learned from, and reflected by non-human systems. A Foundation Model may be trained on this ontology—not to replace authorship or stewardship, but to hold the accumulated richness of what has been imagined, tested, lived, and learned.

The community is compensated not for noise, but for **adding viable possibility to the field**.

### **Closing Posture**

Research exists so that:

* possibility may remain generous,  
* reality may remain honest,  
* and life may select what is worth sustaining.

Inverse conducts research so that nothing is forced and nothing that lives is ignored or neglected.

Extraction is not prohibited. Unexamined or consequence-externalised extraction is.

---

## **Section 7 — Relationship to Constituted Operating Companies**

Inverse exists in defined relationship to constituted operating companies (“OpCos”).

This relationship is one of **authorisation, sequencing, and stewardship**, not operation, management, or execution.

Inverse does not run operating companies.  
Inverse does not sell products or services.  
Inverse does not acquire customers or generate revenue.

Those activities belong wholly to OpCos, where authority binds and consequence is borne.

### **7.1 Constitution and Authorisation**

OpCos are constituted downstream of Inverse through explicit stewardship decisions.

Inverse may authorise the creation, continuation, pause, or sunset of an OpCo where research, interpretation, and environmental conditions indicate that something may be capable of living in the world.

Such authorisation does not guarantee success.  
It permits exposure to consequence.

Inverse does not grant authority to act; constitutions do.  
Inverse governs whether and when constitutions should be brought into being.

### **7.2 Sequencing and Pacing**

Inverse governs **sequencing**, not activity.

This includes determining:

* when something is premature,  
* when conditions are not yet conducive,  
* when growth would erode coherence,  
* or when restraint is required to preserve option value.

Inverse may slow, pause, or defer OpCo activity without intervening in execution. These acts are not vetoes of intent; they are stewardship decisions about timing and environment.

Sequencing preserves the health of the portfolio as a whole.

### **7.3 Portfolio Coherence**

Inverse holds responsibility for **portfolio-level coherence**.

This includes:

* preventing destructive coupling between OpCos,  
* avoiding internal competition that erodes shared ground,  
* ensuring that no single success distorts orientation or governance for the whole,  
* and maintaining clarity of lineage, authority, and responsibility across entities.

Inverse does not optimise the portfolio for short-term return.  
It preserves the conditions under which **organic growth may compound over time**.

### **7.4 Stewardship Without Execution**

Inverse does not intervene in:

* product design,  
* pricing,  
* hiring,  
* customer acquisition,  
* or operational strategy.

Where execution fails, succeeds, or diverges, response occurs through:

* interpretation,  
* constraint,  
* revocation where necessary,  
* or dissolution of pathways.

Inverse does not correct execution.  
It governs whether execution should continue.

### **7.5 Revocation and Sunset**

Inverse may revoke stewardship support for an OpCo where continuation would:

* externalise consequence,  
* erode coherence,  
* or require interpretation to collapse under pressure.

Revocation does not imply wrongdoing.  
It is a recognition that life has failed to sustain itself under present conditions.

Sunset is treated as completion, not failure.

### **7.6 Economic Participation**

OpCos are expected to be **economically self-sustaining**.

Inverse may participate economically in OpCos through defined mechanisms that reflect stewardship contribution and long-term coherence, not operational control or performance optimisation.

Economic participation is aligned with:

* preservation of portfolio integrity,  
* protection of optionality,  
* and long-term compounding of value.

Inverse does not extract value without bearing consequence.  
All economic participation remains subject to the Sovereignty Axiom as defined in the Glossary.

### **Closing Posture**

Inverse stands between possibility and life.

It authorises what may be planted, tends the environment in which it grows, and withdraws support when life no longer sustains itself.

Inverse does not guarantee success.  
It guarantees responsibility.

---

## **Section 8 — Capital, Risk, and Stewardship**

Inverse holds responsibility for the stewardship of **capital and risk** as conditions within which life may or may not unfold.

Capital is not a validator of truth.  
Risk is not a defect to be eliminated.  
Both are signals that require interpretation.

Inverse does not deploy capital to compel outcomes. It does not use capital to accelerate growth, override coherence, or substitute for readiness. Capital is introduced only where research, interpretation, and environmental conditions indicate that exposure to consequence is appropriate.

Risk is treated as information.

Inverse interprets risk to understand:

* where optionality is real versus illusory,  
* where exposure is proportional versus extractive,  
* and where continuation would externalise consequence beyond what can be responsibly borne.

Inverse may accept risk where context entails it.  
Inverse may refuse risk where consequence would be displaced.

Such decisions are not moral judgments. They are acts of stewardship grounded in responsibility for the whole.

Capital allocation, participation, or withdrawal may be used to:

* preserve portfolio coherence,  
* maintain option value,  
* prevent destructive coupling,  
* or allow time for conditions to change.

Inverse does not optimise capital for short-term return.  
It preserves the conditions under which **long-term, organic compounding** remains possible.

Where economic participation exists, it reflects stewardship contribution rather than operational control. Inverse does not extract value without bearing consequence, and does not permit capital to become a proxy for authority.

All capital-related decisions are subject to revocation where misalignment emerges. Withdrawal of capital is a valid act of care when continuation would require the externalisation of risk.

By stewarding capital and risk in this way, Inverse affirms that:

* exposure is preferable to insulation,  
* prudence is preferable to optimisation,  
* and restraint is preferable to forced growth.

Capital serves life when it is placed with responsibility.  
Risk serves coherence when it is interpreted honestly.

---

## **Section 9 — Non-Execution and Boundary Enforcement**

Inverse recognises **non-execution** as a primary and necessary expression of stewardship.

Non-execution is not inaction.  
It is the deliberate refusal to assume roles, powers, or responsibilities that would collapse interpretation into execution or displace consequence.

Inverse does not build, sell, operate, or deliver.  
It does not hire operational teams, manage products, negotiate customers, or pursue market traction. These acts belong wholly to constituted operating companies.

Where pressure arises for Inverse to act operationally—whether through urgency, opportunity, success, or failure—Inverse enforces boundaries by refusal.

This refusal is not obstruction.  
It is protection of coherence.

### **9.1 Boundary Enforcement**

Boundary enforcement is a core governance function.

Inverse enforces boundaries to ensure that:

* interpretation does not become command,  
* stewardship does not become control,  
* and execution does not offload responsibility upward.

Boundary enforcement may include:

* declining to intervene in operational disputes,  
* refusing to provide tactical direction,  
* withdrawing interpretive support where dependency forms,  
* or requiring constitution to bear consequence directly.

Such enforcement preserves clarity of authority across the system.

### **9.2 Protection Against Role Collapse**

Inverse actively protects against role collapse, including:

* authorship being coerced by execution pressure,  
* execution seeking interpretive cover to avoid consequence,  
* or capital demanding governance authority by proxy.

Where such collapse is detected, Inverse responds through:

* clarification of role,  
* reassertion of constraint,  
* revocation of pathways where necessary,  
* or withdrawal of stewardship support.

Role clarity is preserved through action and refusal in equal measure.

### **9.3 Non-Intervention as Care**

Inverse does not intervene to rescue failing execution.

Failure is a form of feedback.  
Intervention that removes consequence undermines learning and coherence.

Inverse may pause, revoke, or sunset pathways where continuation would externalise harm, but it does not manage execution to prevent failure.

Non-intervention, where appropriate, is an act of care toward the system as a whole.

### **Closing Posture**

Inverse remains legitimate by **not becoming what it is not**.

It enforces boundaries so that:

* authors may author freely,  
* operators may act decisively,  
* and consequence remains where it belongs.

Non-execution is therefore not a limitation of Inverse.  
It is the condition of its sovereignty.

---

## **Section 10 — Change, Amendment, and Continuity**

Inverse recognises that stewardship must evolve.

Change within Inverse is permitted and expected, but it must occur **explicitly, accountably, and without collapsing role boundaries**.

This Constitution may be amended only through deliberate governance processes that preserve:

* the separation between authorship, interpretation, and execution,  
* the sovereignty of stewardship,  
* and the requirement that consequence remain visible and borne.

Change is not inferred from success, failure, capital pressure, or market conditions.  
Change is enacted intentionally.

### **10.1 Amendment**

Amendments to this Constitution must:

* be explicit and recorded,  
* preserve interpretive sovereignty without becoming originary,  
* and maintain non-execution as a core constraint.

No amendment may grant Inverse authority to author orientation or execute outcomes. Such authority is structurally excluded.

Amendment refines stewardship.  
It does not redefine its nature.

### **10.2 Continuity of Stewardship**

Inverse is constituted to provide continuity of stewardship across time, not to assert institutional permanence.

Continuity is achieved through:

* clarity of role,  
* disciplined governance,  
* and transferability of stewardship without dilution of responsibility.

Stewardship may be exercised by different people or configurations over time, provided the constitutional boundaries remain intact.

No individual is indispensable to stewardship.  
Responsibility is institutional, not personal.

### **10.3 Succession and Transition**

Where stewardship transitions occur—whether planned or unplanned—Inverse is responsible for ensuring that:

* interpretive authority is transferred deliberately,  
* unresolved tensions are not concealed,  
* and no execution responsibilities are absorbed to stabilise transition.

Succession is treated as a stewardship event, not an operational one.

### **10.4 Dissolution**

Inverse may one day cease to exist.

Dissolution does not negate interpretation performed in good faith, nor does it invalidate pathways that have entered execution under constitution.

Upon dissolution, Inverse’s responsibility is limited to:

* the orderly withdrawal of stewardship,  
* the clear handoff or cessation of interpretive authority,  
* and the prevention of governance vacuum where possible.

Stewardship ends without mythologising its necessity.

### **Closing Posture**

Inverse exists to hold meaning steady as reality moves.

It is not permanent by right.  
It is legitimate by conduct.

If Inverse fulfils its role—tending conditions, governing coherence, enforcing boundaries, and bearing responsibility—then its continuity is earned.

If it no longer does so, its withdrawal is an act of integrity.

---

## **Glossary — Inverse Constitution**

**Authorship**  
The explicit act of originating orientation, conjecture, theory, or art by an identifiable human. Authorship initiates possibility without obligation to become real and carries responsibility without privilege.

**Re-Authorship**  
A new act of authorship that amends or withdraws an existing orientation through explicit, recorded action. Re-authorship influences the system upstream without coercing downstream outcomes.

**Orientation**  
An authored directional posture that shapes how reality is approached without asserting instruction, policy, or truth.

**Principal Frame of Orientation**  
An authored expression of directed will that precedes interpretation, constitution, and execution. It orients without compelling and persists independently of the author’s continued presence.

**Stewardship**  
The sovereign domain of interpretation, governance, and constraint. Stewardship translates orientation into reference, tends conditions, and bears responsibility for coherence across time without executing outcomes.

**Interpretive Sovereignty**  
The lawful authority to contextualise orientation into reference—boundaries, sequencing, and governance—without becoming originary or executive.

**Interpretation**  
A bounded form of authorship exercised within stewardship. Interpretation is accountable, revisable, and consequence-aware; it does not rewrite orientation.

**Coherence**  
The condition in which orientation, interpretation, constitution, and consequence remain non-contradictory across time. Coherence tolerates diversity and failure; it refuses drift that externalises consequence.

**Research**  
Entailment-driven inquiry that tests hypotheses against reality, maps optionality, and informs stewardship decisions about pacing, constraint, or progression—without forcing execution.

**Optionality Space**  
The set of paths entailed between orientation and execution, including what must be true (structural), what is true now (contingent), and what could become true (conditional).

**Market (as Soil)**  
The environment in which execution may or may not sustain life. The market is tended through conditions (timing, narrative, structure), not forced through optimisation.

**Constitution**  
A binding legal and operational framework under which execution occurs. Constitution is where authority attaches, obligations bind, and consequence is borne.

**Operating Company (OpCo)**  
A constituted entity authorised to act in reality under its own constitution, bearing consequence directly and sustaining itself without upstream explanation.

**Execution / Rendering**  
Action carried out within constitutional bounds by human or non-human actors. Execution does not interpret orientation or author meaning.

**Non-Human Executor**  
An automated or artificial system authorised to render action within a constitution. It does not interpret intent or hold sovereignty; responsibility remains human.

**Revocation**  
A stewardship act that withdraws interpretive pathways, permissions, or mandates when continuation would externalise consequence or erode coherence. Revocation is consequence-bound, not moral.

**Capital**  
A tool and signal introduced where exposure to consequence is appropriate. Capital does not validate truth or confer authority.

**Risk**  
Information about exposure and consequence. Risk is interpreted, accepted, refused, or withdrawn by stewardship; it is not eliminated by optimisation.

**Extraction**  
The act of deriving value, resource, or advantage from a system, environment, or field.  
Extraction is coherent only where the extractor bears the **full, visible, and ongoing consequence** of the act.  
Extraction that refuses, obscures, externalises, or displaces its own consequence is prohibited.  
Nothing is otherwise forbidden.

**Life** *(as used in this Constitution)*  
That which can **sustain itself over time under consequence**.  
Life is not popularity, growth rate, or approval.  
Life is continued existence without explanation—where what persists does so because conditions support it and responsibility is borne.  
Something that requires constant justification or insulation from consequence is not life.

**Legacy**  
Preservation of integrity beyond the lifespan of an entity. Legacy does not imply permanence or control—only fidelity to orientation and responsibility.
