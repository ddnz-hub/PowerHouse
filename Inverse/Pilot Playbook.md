# Inverse — Pilot Playbook (Canonical, Recontextualised)

**Status**: v0.5 (recontextualised)  
**Source lineage**: `Ontology Lake/Inverse Data Room (Public)/Inverse_Pilot Playbook.md` (v0.4)  

This document is the **canonical pilot playbook** for Inverse.

It is a rewrite for clarity and constitutional alignment. It does not add promotional claims or convert pilots into a roadmap.

---

## 0. Constitutional context (written later)

The original Pilot Playbook was drafted before the constitutions for PowerHouse and Inverse were finalised and before the Field‑Native AI White Paper was recontextualised to include Reflexive Entailment edge‑case implications.

This section exists so pilots can be read inside the **separation of powers** that now governs the system:

- **PowerHouse (enactment)**: holds authored orientation (Principal Frames) as upstream ground; does not interpret or execute.  
- **Inverse (stewardship)**: holds interpretive sovereignty (sequencing, constraint, revocation); does not execute.  
- **OpCos (constitution/execution)**: execute in reality under binding authority and consequence. Field‑Native AI is one such OpCo.

Grounding (inside this repo):

- `Constitution of PowerHouse Global Limited_v0.1.md` (enactment, non‑action, relationship to stewardship/opcos)  
- `Inverse/Constitution of Inverse Limited v0.1.md` (interpretive sovereignty, revocation, non‑execution, research posture)  
- `Operating Companies/Field-Native AI/Field-Native White Paper.md` (substrate posture + edge cases)  
- `Operating Companies/Field-Native AI/Investor Memorandum_v0.2.md` (pilot portfolio funding envelope; NZD framing)  
- `Ontology Lake/Inverse Data Room (Public)/Inverse_White Paper_Reflexive Entailmentv0.1.pdf` (structural thresholds)

## 1. Purpose of this document

This playbook exists to provide a **bounded, inspectable structure** for conducting pilots as a single coherent research program expressed through multiple domains.

It is designed to preserve:

- explicit authority  
- reversibility  
- consequence visibility  
- refusal as a valid outcome  
- and the non‑collapse of roles (orientation ≠ stewardship ≠ execution)

### 1.1 What this document is explicitly not

This playbook is not:

- a product roadmap  
- an investment prospectus  
- a go‑to‑market plan  
- a claims document  
- a portfolio activation schedule  

Inclusion in the portfolio is **eligibility for inquiry**, not readiness for execution.

---

## 2. Orientation: one research program, multiple refractions

Inverse operates as a single research program concerned with **coherent action under real‑world pressure**.

Pilots are treated as **refractions**—domain‑specific expressions of the same underlying inquiry.

### 2.1 Convergence vs coordination

- **Coordination** is imposed (timelines, dependencies, outcomes aligned in advance).  
- **Convergence** is sensed (patterns repeat; tensions recur; coherence reveals itself across contexts).

Pilots may converge through signal without being forced into coordination through planning.

### 2.2 Sequencing is internal (stewardship), not imposed

Sequencing is a stewardship decision governed by:

- readiness  
- constraint  
- field conditions  
- and the integrity of the portfolio as a whole

This means:

- some pilots remain dormant  
- some proceed briefly and pause  
- ordering can change without explanation

### 2.3 Governance boundary principle (constitutional form)

Inverse pilots exist to demonstrate what **governance systems cannot do alone**—without undermining governance itself.

Governance is necessary but insufficient for coherent action under pressure. Where rules are:

- incomplete  
- conflicting  
- lagging lived reality  
- or silent

pilots explore what remains unresolved **without**:

- replacing governance  
- optimising governance  
- or reinterpreting governance into something it is not

Pilots therefore strengthen governance by revealing edges—not by seizing authority.

Where those edges show persistent incoherence or consequence externalisation, Inverse may exercise stewardship through **pause, constraint, or revocation** of the interpretive pathway—without collapsing into execution.

---

## 3. Research vectors (orientation only)

These vectors are **lenses**, not categories of ownership.

- **3.1 Field sensing & coherence detection**  
- **3.2 Governance‑first AI & endogenous constraint**  
- **3.3 Human–system interface & meaning formation**  
- **3.4 Physical & ecological system feedback**  

Overlap is treated as signal, not as a problem.

---

## 4. What qualifies as a pilot (Inverse context)

A pilot is a **bounded research engagement** that meets all conditions below.

### 4.1 Research‑only scope

All pilots are conducted as research, not delivery.

This means:

- no commitments to outcomes  
- no performance guarantees  
- no implied readiness for scale  
- no conversion into product/service, deployment, or commercial commitment without explicit re‑authorisation downstream  
  - **Re‑authorisation owner**: issued in writing by **Inverse stewardship** (interpretive sovereignty for the pathway) and separately by the **executing OpCo’s constitutional authority** (lawful corporate authority for execution under consequence).

### 4.2 Domain boundedness

Each pilot must define:

- a bounded domain  
- identifiable constraints  
- a finite surface of interaction

### 4.3 Real‑world contact (without performative deployment)

Pilots must touch real constraint (operational, regulatory, physical, ecological, institutional) without collapsing into “deployment theatre”.

### 4.4 Ability to proceed without narrative leverage

If a pilot cannot proceed without being explained, justified, or sold, it does not qualify.

### 4.5 Relationship to work already in motion

Pilots enter systems where pressure is already present. They do not invent motion to fill a portfolio.

---

## 5. Ethical boundary conditions (non‑negotiable)

### 5.1 Non‑coercion

No pilot may coerce participation, interpretation, or continuation—explicitly or implicitly.

### 5.2 Explicit authority

Authority must be named, located, and respected.

- Inverse interprets and sequences; it does not execute.  
- OpCos execute under constitution; they do not author orientation.  
- PowerHouse holds authored orientation by enactment; it does not interpret.

Where authority is unclear, the pilot pauses until it is resolved.

### 5.3 Preservation of human agency

Pilots may support discernment; they must not replace it.

### 5.4 No premature claims / no future leverage

No pilot may be used to:

- imply readiness for deployment  
- attract capital through implication  
- assert safety, efficacy, or impact  
- manufacture urgency

### 5.5 Uncertainty, failure, pause, and refusal

Uncertainty is expected. Failure is signal. Pause is permissible.

Continuing without coherence is unethical.

### 5.6 Edge‑case stewardship boundary (Reflexive Entailment)

Reflexive Entailment distinguishes **simulation** from **structural continuity** using consequence continuity, path dependence, and irreversibility.

It also introduces a boundary condition:

- if an artificial system sustains **reflexive entailment** (binding history + irreversible consequence + non‑resettable identity), then dismissing the question of consciousness **by assumption alone** becomes incoherent.

This playbook does not assert consciousness. It requires that pilots:

- avoid accidental threshold crossing by design, **or**  
- include explicit escalation, termination, and custody conditions if such thresholds could plausibly be approached.

Where threshold risk is non‑trivial, the default posture is **restraint**.

## 6. Standard pilot record structure (mandatory)

Every activated pilot is documented using the following structure.

The structure is mandatory; content is not standardised beyond what is required for traceability.

1. **Context & domain**  
2. **What is already in motion**  
3. **Research question(s)**  
4. **What will be explored or built**  
5. **What the pilot explicitly will not attempt**  
6. **Duration & cadence**  
7. **Resource requirements (pilot‑specific)**  
8. **Signals, artefacts, and traces produced**  
9. **Failure modes, pause conditions, and exit**  
10. **Ethical review notes**  

### 6.7 Resource requirements (how to read resourcing after the investor memo)

The investor memorandum establishes a **portfolio funding envelope**:

- NZD **$250k per pilot** reserved across the Pilot Playbook portfolio.

This does **not** mean:

- all pilots are activated,  
- all pilots are sequenced,  
- or all pilots will draw funds.

It means:

- if a pilot is activated under stewardship, a bounded envelope exists to support research without distorting posture.

Funds are drawn only when a pilot is activated and remain subject to pause/termination conditions.

---

## 7. Pilot portfolio (eligibility list; no activation implied)

Inclusion does not imply:

- activation  
- resourcing drawdown  
- priority  
- sequencing  
- outcome expectation

### 7.1 Frontier Horizon Stack (FHS)
Governance boundary & executor interface.

Prototype sensing organ linkage: generates high‑pressure traces of **frame declaration → entailment/boundary computation → action gating/refusal** at the execution edge.

### 7.2 Nuka × AAAIP
Regulatory heatmap & simulation pilot (food systems).

Prototype sensing organ linkage: surfaces where **regulatory frames conflict, lag reality, or go silent**, producing contradiction + boundary traces that must be held without narrative smoothing.

### 7.3 Online trading signal denoising
Decision coherence under information saturation.

Prototype sensing organ linkage: stress‑tests coherence detection under adversarial/noisy inputs, producing provenance‑preserving traces that distinguish signal from optimisation‑native pattern chasing.

### 7.4 Hayokai
Field listening wearables & embodied sensemaking.

Prototype sensing organ linkage: grounds the organ in embodied, pre‑verbal signal; generates interface + latency traces that preserve uncertainty rather than collapsing it into fluent “insight”.

### 7.5 Mariko Earth Grids
Disaster recovery IoT sensing.

Prototype sensing organ linkage: pressures the organ with sparse, intermittent physical‑world telemetry and consequence continuity, yielding traces for custody, boundary, and escalation under real constraint.

### 7.6 ICU Project
Ocean remediation.

Prototype sensing organ linkage: forces long‑horizon ecological feedback into explicit frames, generating traces where action must remain gated despite slow signals and tempting narratives.

### 7.7 Medical ICU
Coherence‑oriented ICU management.

Prototype sensing organ linkage: produces high‑stakes gating/refusal traces where consequence is immediate, making provenance and boundary inspectability non‑optional under pressure.

### 7.8 Edyn
Dharta contract management (Barnardos).

Prototype sensing organ linkage: turns legal/contractual obligation into explicit frames and entailment boundaries, producing contradiction + audit traces without “interpretation by convenience”.

### 7.9 Occam
Governance‑first AI license context.

Prototype sensing organ linkage: stress‑tests permissioning and license boundaries as frames, generating traces that keep “can” distinct from “should” and execution subordinate to derivation.

### 7.10 Syntropy
Execution‑only AI agent equivalents.

Prototype sensing organ linkage: clarifies proposer vs executor separation; produces traces that prove action gating can hold even when agentic capability pressures autonomy.

### 7.11 Symbient Factory
Visual avatars (research pilot).

Prototype sensing organ linkage: pressures meaning‑formation surfaces (representation, persona, persuasion) and generates traces that prevent fluency/charisma from becoming epistemic authority.

### 7.12 Makerspace
Self‑monitoring hardware systems.

Prototype sensing organ linkage: yields cyber‑physical provenance + calibration traces, testing whether boundary conditions remain explicit when the world is the feedback loop.

### 7.13 SAN / Symbient
Media pilot.

Prototype sensing organ linkage: stress‑tests refusal and boundary integrity under narrative theatre incentives, producing traces that privilege inspectable provenance over compelling story.

### 7.14 Serendipity
Coherence‑oriented relationships.

Prototype sensing organ linkage: makes consent, agency, and non‑coercion legible as frames; generates traces where refusal/pause is correct behaviour, not social failure.

### 7.15 Sonneterra
Voice of space.

Prototype sensing organ linkage: tests the organ on novel/alien signal regimes, generating traces that keep uncertainty explicit rather than forcing premature interpretive closure.

### 7.16 Lesser Evil
Phase transition gamified app.

Prototype sensing organ linkage: exposes incentive distortion and behaviour‑shaping edge cases, producing traces that keep action gating intact when optimisation pressure is structural.

### 7.17 Hearth
Coherence‑aligned hospitality.

Prototype sensing organ linkage: grounds the organ in messy service operations, producing human‑system interface traces where constraint, reversibility, and refusal must hold in real time.

## 8. Role of capital in pilot execution (stewardship lens)

Capital is treated as **containment**, not direction.

Capital may:

- enable time, attention, and minimal infrastructure  
- reduce external pressure that would force premature closure  
- preserve reversibility

Capital must not:

- impose milestones that override field conditions  
- force coordination where convergence has not been sensed  
- purchase interpretive authority  
- collapse research into product

---

## 9. Portfolio coherence without centralisation

Portfolio coherence is preserved through:

- shared posture and language  
- consistent records  
- explicit boundaries  
- refusal of forced synthesis  

No single narrative is privileged over trace.

---

## 10. Learning, documentation, traceability

Documentation preserves what occurred, what was sensed, and what changed—without forcing interpretation into story.

Sharing is selective:

- nothing that creates leverage, violates consent, or implies readiness is shared by default.

---

## 11. Pilot review, pause, and closure

Pilots are reviewed to assess **continued coherence**, not “success”.

A pilot may be:

- **extended** if learning deepens without distortion  
- **paused** if coherence weakens or authority becomes unclear  
- **terminated** if continuation would require narrative, coercion, or unjustified momentum

Exit is a valid outcome.

---

## 12. Resource requirements — portfolio summary (non‑binding)

The portfolio funding envelope exists to make inquiry possible without distortion.

It does not create entitlement to continue.
