# Inverse

Inverse exists to steward the responsible unfolding of authored orientation into reality.

This repository is the **stewardship layer** of a wider system that separates authorship, interpretation, and execution so that consequence can be borne without distortion.

Inverse does not originate authorship.  
Inverse does not execute outcomes.  
Inverse holds interpretation, sequencing, and custodial judgment.

## What Lives Here

Inverse holds **interpretation and stewardship**, not origination or delivery.

Here you will find:
- the **Statement of Posture** for Inverse
- governance logic derived from authored orientation
- sequencing and custodial decisions
- interfaces between orientation and constitution

Nothing in this repository is a product.  
Nothing here is transactional or enforceable on its own.

## Relationship to the System

Inverse sits **between** orientation and consequence.

- **Upstream**:  
  Authored **Principal Frames of Orientation**  
  held in PowerHouse

- **Downstream**:  
  **Constitutions** of operating companies (OpCos)  
  where authority binds and consequence lands

- **Execution**:  
  Rendered by human and non-human executors  
  within constitutional bounds

Inverse interprets orientation into reference.  
It does not rewrite orientation.  
It does not execute constitutions
