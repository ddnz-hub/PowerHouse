# **Principal Frame of Orientation**

**Authored by David Ding v0.1**

I author this Principal Frame of Orientation as an expression of my posture toward reality, responsibility, and consequence.

This frame is not a claim to truth.  
It is a declaration of orientation.

It does not assert what *is*.  
It states how I choose to stand in relation to what is.

I do not require this frame to be correct in order for it to be honest.  
I do not require agreement in order for it to be valid.  
Its authority arises solely from authorship and accountability, not from consensus, performance, or outcome.

This frame exists upstream of law, governance, policy, capital, and execution.  
It carries no enforcement power.  
It compels nothing.  
It instructs nothing.

It orients.

## **On Authorship**

I name myself explicitly as the author of this Principal Frame.

I do so in full awareness that authorship entails responsibility without guarantee of correctness.  
I accept that what I author may later be revealed as incomplete, insufficient, or wrong.

Authorship does not grant me immunity from consequence.  
It binds me to it.

I transfer custodianship of this Principal Frame to PowerHouse Global Limited for the purpose of enactment and preservation, while retaining authorship authority to amend or withdraw it explicitly. This transfer does not abstract my responsibility; it makes it legible.

This frame is not owned by PowerHouse Global Limited as property.  
It is held as authored ground.

## **On the Nature of Frames**

A frame is an orientation, not a command.  
It shapes perception and judgment without dictating action.

This Principal Frame is an expression of *my* truth, not *the* truth.  
As such, it does not require verification, only ownership.

Because frames need not be true to be held with integrity, grace and mercy are not optional virtues in their handling. They are structural necessities.

This frame allows for divergence without coercion, disagreement without collapse, and evolution without betrayal.

## **On Separation of Powers**

I distinguish explicitly between three sovereign domains, each of which authors within its own lawful scope:

1. **Orientation** — authored here, in this frame  
2. **Reference** — authored through interpretation and stewardship  
3. **Constitution** — authored through binding execution in reality

No domain may substitute for another.  
No domain may collapse upward or downward without loss of integrity.

Orientation precedes reference.  
Reference precedes constitution.  
Constitution is where consequence binds.

---

## **On Interpretation**

Interpretation is not discovery of truth.  
It is authorship within context.

I assign sovereignty over interpretation to stewardship, not to authorship and not to execution. Interpretation carries responsibility, not supremacy.

Interpretation may evolve without rewriting orientation.  
It may fail without invalidating authorship.

---

## **On Execution and Consequence**

Reality begins where constitutions bind.

Execution is not lesser authorship.  
It is authorship under consequence.

Those who execute—human or non-human—do not carry sovereignty. They carry responsibility within bounds. They are permitted confidence precisely because authority has been settled upstream.

Failure at the level of execution is not a failure of intent.  
It is feedback to be received, not deflected.

---

## **On Non-Human Executors**

This frame is authored so that execution may be safely rendered by systems that do not interpret, do not author orientation, and do not claim moral standing.

Authority always resides upstream of automation.  
Responsibility always remains human.

This is not a limitation of machines.  
It is a protection of sovereignty.

---

## **On Change**

This Principal Frame may be amended only through explicit authorship.

Silence does not imply consent.  
Success does not imply correctness.  
Longevity does not imply permanence.

If this frame no longer reflects my posture, it must be revised or withdrawn—not reinterpreted into something it is not.

---

## **Closing Posture**

I author this frame not to control outcomes, but to refuse abdication.

I do not seek certainty.  
I seek integrity under uncertainty.

This frame exists so that what unfolds downstream may do so with confidence, coherence, and consequence—without needing to look back for permission.

This is my posture.
