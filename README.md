# PowerHouse

PowerHouse exists to hold and enact **Principal Frames of Orientation**.

This repository is the upstream root of authorship for a broader regenerative system that includes research, stewardship, execution, and commercialisation. Nothing in this repository is operational, transactional, or enforceable on its own.

Its role is orientation, not instruction.

## What Lives Here

PowerHouse is the home of **Principal Frames of Orientation** authored by identifiable humans and held with explicit responsibility.

A Principal Frame:
- is a statement of posture, not a claim to truth
- precedes IP, governance, policy, and capital
- carries no enforcement power
- exists to orient interpretation and constitution downstream

Principal Frames are **enacted**, not interpreted, at this layer.

---

## Authorship

Each Principal Frame is explicitly authored and owned in the human sense before being transferred into PowerHouse for custodial holding.

Authorship remains accountable, amendable, and withdrawable by the author. PowerHouse does not abstract or anonymise authorship. It preserves it.

---

## Relationship to the Wider System

PowerHouse sits upstream of:

- **Stewardship and Interpretation**  
  held by Inverse

- **Constitution and Execution**  
  held by operating companies (OpCos)

- **Rendering and Delivery**  
  performed by human and non-human executors under constitutional authority

PowerHouse does not:
- govern
- transact
- interpret
- execute

It orients.

## How to Read This Repository

If you are here looking for:
- products → you are too early
- strategy → you are in the wrong layer
- execution → you are downstream
- certainty → you will not find it here

If you are here to understand **where authority begins**, you are in the right place.

Start with the Principal Frame of Orientation.

## Status

This integrity of this repository is dependent upon restraint. rather than execution.

Nothing should be added here unless it is authored at the level of orientation and responsibility.
